positive	We lived the cleaners of the entire hotel plus facilities and tv ! Great friendly staff and very professional . We have changed hotel this time to be close to the sea and we retreat it , we will I'll go back to premier next visit to Dubai .
positive	1 fast elevator in hotel, sometimes i have to wait around 5 mins.Cozy room, Located north of shinjuku station not far from station, restaurants, grocery shop, Lawson, and can walk back safely to hotel even on night. Pillow is different, like there are Beads inside pillow instead of feather. but hotel also offer normal pillow as well, also free nice-breakfast for every guest
positive	Great wifi, friendly host, excellent location near temple area.
positive	Great location to the slopes and within the town, basic accommodations, onsen
positive	Maybe just a few extra towels.we loved how a lot of things were within walking distance. The hotel was nice and clean and had friendly staff. The parking and wifi was free ! The kids enjoyed seeing the dogs walking around too.
positive	Found out about the spa/salon at the top of the property on the final day. No advertisement for this; minimal signs as well advising of them being thereBeautiful area, many different stores, shops, stalls, banks, attractions right in the area, plus excellent staff, truly excellent on site restaurant (sandcastles) and beautiful rooms/ Private beach area is much appreciated as well
positive	The room extremely amazing. My room view to the mountain!
positive	The loudness of the cleaning staff in the morning.Excellent location, close to tram station 9,which will take you to the city center. Only one problem :in the morning the cleaning staff was too loud. If you so something, it doesn't mean you have to wake up everybody. Other than that, perfect! You can buy transport tickets from the reception, change money etc.
positive	Only but is the amount and pressure of the water in the bathroom. Other than that, all is great.I stayed in the room with the balcony and private bathroom. The bed was very comfy and the room quite spacious. The breakfast was delicious and freshly prepared in-house each morning. Fernando and his team are very warm and helpful. Do not hesitate to book!
positive	Sofa bed uncomfortable for sitting on. Just comfortable enough size for four but better with three persons. Steep site can't have swimming pool.Appreciated complementary outdoor BBQ, kayaks and bikes. Friendly staff. Brilliant view from top floor. Solid,well maintained construction.
positive	Sometimes the noise of traffic, because we had our room at the front.Fernandino and his wife do everything to make you to enjoy your stay in Oaxaca! We never will forget the way they were ready to help. Each day a marvelous breakfast.
positive	staff polite but not really helping. most staff are fine. but i'm really unsatisfied with one lady in reception.. we lost the key for the lock on luggage. tried to borrow a screwdriver or plier to open it. I asked her several time. She simply said "we don't have". I asked her to check with maintenance. She directly replied " we don't have". I insisted on her calling the maintenance. I spoke to maintenance directly. staff of maintenance said they have both. The guy came to our room and found the problem. To open it better, he went to bring a saw, which is really helpful.good deco, room,
positive	why would they right down your credit card no after you had already paid for this. I asked him what the reason was he said it was for security.???? did not feel very comfortable about this at all
positive	Great location - close to subway. Small, but very clean, cosy and nice room with everything nesessary for life. Very convenient and cheap coin-laundry. Liked this hotel!
positive	Very friendly helpful staff . Great location. As female travelers we felt very safe in this location.
positive	This hotel is not expensive but they managed to ensuite small onsen, thanks:)! Pillows choice was also very nice. Breakfast included both Japanese style morning food and European (bakery, coffee, omelet). If you are in Tokyo for shopping, not only for sightseeing - the district is highly recommended and Super Hotel is good choice there.
positive	First of all the people are amazing!! Very welcoming, willing to help in everything! We have nothing bad to say about it. Very nice area, room, clean, the toilet has an amazing decor. The pool area during the summer looks like an amazing way to spend a summer afternoon! I would definitely go back!
positive	Great views from the roof terrace and the accommodation were well appointed and comfortable. Ideal location 100 metres from Monastraki square and metro with direct trains to the airport. Our favourite taverna is nearby too.
positive	There are no curtains, only a mesh type screen. Douche has no hose. There is no toilet brush in the washroom.Exceptionally attentive staff Quiet at night Convenient, safe and respectable location Everything in the unit works Large quality electronic safety box in the unit Clean, modern, professional Good value
positive	The garage is too narrow.The rooms are neat and the beds are very comfortable. The location is great. You will be able to visit many cities nearby. Staff was great, mainly Sr Antonio, the hotel´s manager. The porch we had in our room made all the difference. I do recommend!
positive	The room facilities felt a bit old.The room is super spacious compared to other hotels with same price! Three types of breakfast to choose and we tried the Japanese one which was good.
positive	We would have been happy with just toast and/or cereal for breakfast - the full three-course affair was sometimes a bit much for first thing in the morning.The staff were very helpful and accommodating. The onsen was a welcome relief after being on the slopes. And the kids loved the massage chairs.
positive	The staff are always so helpful and kind! The loft rooms offered lots of space and the kitchen was well equipped. We love staying at this property because it's good value and offers kitchens so we can cook some of own meals.
positive	NothingStaff were very friendly, top view of the balcony, we got sick in Oaxaca and they provide us a great hotel doctor... Booking gave us the wrong price but we got a great discount price without any problems.. I highly recommend it!!!
positive	The rooms are always spotlessly clean and fresh. Water pressure is great and the beds are really comfy. Whole motel is quiet as, means you get a great nights rest and there's heaps of space. When booking, the staff go out of their way to accommodate ( sorry ) any requests made.
positive	No hot water.do not leave any food in the room or ants will invade lol like lot of place in bali.Really cheap, food here is very good, family staff are very nice. Quiet location, just 5-10min walking from Uluwatu. Scooter rental in good conditions
positive	lots of space in the room I had. Breakfasts pretty good too.
positive	I think the housekeeping service was little slow ,ask for a toothbrush it's came after 3 calls.Location and the room.check in was very easy I stayed this property before as well but this time we feel very comfortable during our check in receptionist the girl called Ayesha (sorry if the name is wrong)did an excellent job.
positive	no toiletry swimming pool close very earlyhelpful and quick response from reception enough shaded car parking secure and safe place only customers of same floor can go there
positive	The breakfast rate was an extraordinary 122 dirhams! which I declined. If I had breakfast on all four mornings it was reduced to 74 dirhams!I arrived at 11.45am but was given a room immediately. A wonderful walk-in, easy to use shower with all necessary add-ons provided. Hotel is located a couple of minutes from the huge Al Wahda Mall with the bus station directly opposite that and a direct service to and from Dubai 
positive	If you want to ho to the Kruger they are a bit further apart, the best would be to combine a few days here with a night insidd thf parkThe location is amazing ! A very comfortable cabin right in the middle of the bush and by a nice river
positive	At Breakfast the staff is bit slow at times and a bit confused.great location and beautiful design, super relaxing very good food, specially the lunch menu. We love it
positive	Poolside service could have been better (Kruntherp Wing), especially as it was not very clear where the bar was.Excellent outside space facing the river (pool etc) in a very crowded city. The upgrade package (breakfast, afternoon tea, cocktails and canapés) is worth being the extra for as it takes away any worries about the "add on costs" that can be significant in a 5 star hotel.
positive	We were in C block across the Rd from supermarket that woke us with very noisy deliveries around 4.15 am that continued for at least 1/2 hrClean tidy units and good value
positive	that we had to pay a fee for the TV remotewe liked that it was located close to restaurants and entertainment
positive	I would recommend to ask for the Koruna exchange rate in the downtown before exchanging it from the hotel.The room is clean. The location is only 10 Min away from the downtown by Tram and the Tram station is just in front of the hotel. You can buy the tram tickets from the reception. The staff are friendly. The breakfast is awesome with a lot of varieties
positive	Parking is first in first serve at $25 per day. Underground parking is secure but very tight spaces.Walking distance to Queen St, value for money, very clean, modern, kitchenette, balcony, Internet.
positive	NothingLocation.Friendly owner. Prashant is very service minded and tries to accommodate all his customers needs . The property offers the feeling of a guesthouse but every room has privacy and is independent
positive	N/A.The moment I arrived I was made to feel welcome, and was provided with a good overview of the area. I only wish I had had at least another night to fully enjoy my time at Vain and in Palermo!
positive	nice room with all comforts. great price for the location and the hotel quality
positive	Fantastic wiew from room. Comfortable beds. Clean. Very good for familys with playground for children. Very nice sri lankan breakfast. A lot of different transport services.
positive	We have to eat when the owner decides (20.00 pm) all together with other guests (it could be nice for someone) The hotel is far from the center, tuk tuk is needed, uphill roadThe room was very big and clean. The owner was very nice person
positive	For the price we think it was above and beyond any expectations.The staff was great, so friendly and willing to give advice. The location was marvelous, so much to do, restaurants, shopping, etc. Loved the beautiful murals everywhere, gives the property a lot of character and we appreciate that when visiting places. Their coffee was very good (I'm a coffee gal).
positive	Very Basic breakfastGood hotel Maybe i will be back one day
positive	Very good beds, awesome girls working there. They really care! Best hostel I ever stayed at.
positive	NOTHING AT ALL, PERFECTThis is a hostel you have to stay at least one night, for sure you will extend your stay! Very clean, beds comfy and the house at itself is the best idea i have seen since a while! Paul was very good host, we had movie nights,snorkel trips and game nights! Staff is friendly. Amazing!
positive	NothingNice modern room with all needs met only there for a few hours so didn't get to experience anything other than a good nights sleep
positive	NothingWonderful views. Quiet space. Comfortable room. Lovely staff
positive	My room was without windowGood position, 10 min walking to beach Clean room with hot water, towels and fridge. (Not usual standard for Bali homestay) Tv and dvd Fun and also air conditioner Friendly family owner
positive	Nothing.Great location - we could walk to JR Station with Tokyo Monorail connection to Haneda airport; and 2 subway lines. We could go almost everywhere we wanted to in downtown Tokyo without changing lines. Very well organized, lots of staff to help you, great buffet with lovely panoramic views. Large bedrooms for Tokyo, and all set in green space. Many small resatuarnts , 7-Eleven, Family Mart etc. within walking distance.
positive	Very comfortable stay in downtown Lisbon. The location is great! The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was nice. Nothing bad to say about this place.
positive	It is a little way to the shops and restaurants but walking is good for you! The bus to Willemstad stops at the end of the road and costs a mere 93 cents...Willemstad is full of restaurants. Other local restaurants such as the Kleine Wereld will send a car to transport you but we preferred to walk!The extraordinary hospitality showed by the owner and the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and at home! The decor was fabulous and very stylish.
positive	The staff was very helpful, and always cheerful and happy :) Everything was nice, clean and comfortable for a great price, also close to the centre :) We only stayed for two nights but we'll definitely come again when we visit Lisbon the next time :)
positive	You can plug a USB into the TV, but you can't watch videos from the USB. My boyfriend and I like to watch our shows this way.The bed was very comfortable and the staff was especially friendly.
positive	I liked everything.The staff is pretty good, a nice oaxacan style hotel, very good breakfast.
positive	The beds were very comfortable, the bathroom was excellent and the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful. The location was really central which made getting around town really easy
positive	Nothing to mentionLoved everything about this hotel, the rooms were very clean, the staff were friendly, breakfast buffet had something for everyone and the selling point for us was the infinity pool overlooking the madness of Bangkok with a very chilled atmosphere! Would definitely return
positive	My room had a little window looking out to other windows. Poor natural lights.The bed and pillows were very supple and comfy. The gym is top grade with up to date equipments.
positive	Very gentle and helpful owners. I would definitely come again.
positive	Good breakfast, helpful staff, clean, good gym, close to airport, shuttle to the beach and shopping centers. The shopping centers are also in a walking distance. Would consider staying there again.
positive	Nothing 😊Good Location, very nice staff - going the extra mile to make your stay extraordinary , breakfast delicious, wifi best I experienced in Thailand! Free water, coffee and tea 24/7. We even got free vietnamese soup once, it was amazing! Very good value for the money, we recommend you coming here!
positive	Dogs around the place, be careful when dark. Maybe the friendly owner is a little bit to involved in the guests conversation during dinner. The kids are fantastic, but its feels strange that they always has to be around new people when they want to watch tv or play game. No wifi in our room. We had two lamps in out room, one of them we had to go to shared room to put on and off...Very friendly family. We good a lot of good information, and they help us with private transportation to Negombo (7000). They served excellent dinner in this place and a generous breakfast. We walk to the tea museum (30 minutes, along nice road). We liked the city of Kandy.
positive	We loved everything.The staff was just exceptional. Friendly and helpful. Loved the shuttle and all the help!!
positive	I basically loved the place. It's a must go place where every traveler would benefit in many ways. the owner and the staff are eager to direct us to places and where to go what to do and what to be careful of. I did not expect this service neither i did not experience this service any where else in the world. comfy beds choice of breakfast good air conditioning and the swimming pool are amazing. i stayed at 6 hostels in the country none had these facilities and friendliness. Sincerely wish these guys luck.. keep up the good work people. A big hug and thank you guys....
positive	Wonderful hotel in St Petersburg Good location (near by the subway station) Good wifi Good breakfast Friendly staff
positive	Bathroom was rather dated with grouting around bath discoloured and cracked giving you the impression that it was dirty.Great Bed and location. This was the 8th time we have stayed at this Hotel.
positive	The shower nozzle.The hotel is situated a few blocks from Merida's epicentre. Staff are kind and helpful (thanks, guys). Our room was fine with an exceptionally large and comfortable bed. Breakfast, included, is modest but healthy and satisfying, served in a cheery atmosphere - you can sit inside (the breakfast room is also a nice little bar) or in the courtyard. Cappuccino (30 pesos extra) is great. Check out the in-house shop featuring Day of the Dead folk art. And be sure to visit the cool, vibrant little Museum of Popular Art just a couple of doors away. The hotel is situated on an interesting square with a 17th C. church and an open area where young people rehearse dance routines.
positive	We had a fantastic stay at Villa16. The family that own it are so friendly and accommodating. It is a beautifully clean house with a large kitchen. We would definitely stay again!
positive	Little bit further from dowtown and when it is really cold outside you might want to drive.Very friendly staff, hot tub, clean and very comfortable room
positive	Ensuite, bigger room, fresh coffeeClean, lovely hosts
positive	I wanted stay longer)Hostel is running by owners and they make it very hospitality. I felt like at home. Its small hostel (1 room) and in the beggining I was a lil suprised. But in few hours I found it very very cool. Less tourists, less noise, more individual service and more relaxing space. Breakfasts were very tasty. Thank you. Owners helped with advices and they cared about all around.
positive	Awesome place to stay during your stay at Gili Meno if you wanna meet some cool people. Hostel is super new, not boring and ordinary but interesting and it won't stop surprise you what else you can find there. Staff is amazingly friendly! I Recommend and promise you won't regret :)
positive	Not really big points.... Wifi in my room was bad. Almost no connection, sometimes only by the door. So i had to go outside or be in the central part. Because its a 24 hours service, late a night there where some guys talking loud in the cafe/restaurant part. Had to ask them to be a little more quiet.... would be nice if the staff asked them to. Further no big thinks.The place/hotel is recently build, so everything is as good as new. Nice room, just what you need. Clean and good. Fine service and friendly people at the desk. I could leave a part of my luggage there, because of my trip to corn island. Real nice. Breakfast is good, but would be nice is there is a little more to choose from, some fruit for example would be nice. Good place, just about 1k walk from the airport. You can take a shuttle for a few $
positive	Central location = noisy at nightSpend one night here. Clean and nice hotel, could recommend. Staff helped with carrying my heavy suitcase up and down the stairs :) Felt a safe place for solo travelers, too.
positive	When I checked in, one customer in front of me wanted to clarify some problems with staff. It took over ten minutes, so others must wait for her. I hope that Generator should hire more staff or train them to make the process smoothly.This place is quite and convenient.
positive	Asking for things during breakfast seemed like a bother , the waiters where more useful than the F and B manager in a suit and tie . All I asked was beans because that all I eat for breakfast and he dismissed the conversation didn't make the effort to see if it possibleThe hotel is amazing , great breakfast ,some of the staff can be rude but the rest make up for it . Really attentive the concierge is the best they helped us with everything , from taxi,dinner reservation to best attractions
positive	not used to the outdoor bathroom. it was raining and i had to hold an umbrella to use the toilet.Food there was g d & not expensive. Got hot water to bathe, not like other villas on the island.
positive	No fan in roomThe property was very inviting and had the traditional Balinese feel in the gardens and villas
positive	NothingThe staff were unbelievably kind, friendly and helpful. The place was spotless from top to bottom-all day. The kitchen has very good facilities and the breakfast is super! The showers had hot water 24/7 and the hostel has a brilliant range of activities making your stay in mendoza so easy! There is a lovely atmosphere and it's easy to meet new friends. Here's tons of movies available if you've time to kill waiting for a bus or something. One of best hostels I've stayed in!
positive	Staff were friendly and helpful. All facilities worked well, and nice location with a 'panorama ' of the town.
positive	Perfect location to stop off on route to Cape Point and a short car ride to Simons town. Great setting up on the hill, lovely pool and breakfast room.
positive	- when travelling by bus, it's too far from downtown - wlan quite weak+ cozy house in calm neighbourhood + clean and well equiped
positive	Small kitchenette, really slow internet, you have to pay extra 50 eur per week to get a fast connectionGreat location close to the beach and the village centre but at the same time quiet. Clean, modern, nicely decorated, large room, friendly staff
positive	They could have better direction for what's what with the tv. Found out on our last day that you can watch Netflix on it which would've been cool if we found out the first night
positive	WiFi wasn't that good; really slow and with disconnects.Friendly staff! Great location just right in front of the beach and in the middle of Zicatela beach. Breakfast was great - 1 dish & 1 drink to choose from the cart, please keep that! Hotel pool and relaxation area is great, clean and really scenic.
positive	can't think of anythingeverything is super clean and comfy
positive	Very quaint room (Shell room) and loved the fact that there was a jug of fresh milk in the fridge for tea/coffee.
positive	Nicholas and Andrea were fantastic. Family and staff made our staff very comfortable. Hope to return and stay again!
positive	It is next to the ocean but there is a road between ocean and hotel.Great service, package deal with massage was excellent. The river rooms are beautiful and the pool is very relaxed.
positive	I have never encountered such lovely, understanding staff, who truly did everything they could to make us feel at home and helped us out as much as they could
negative	the worst experience i have ever had across all the countries i travelled.. via booking.com. The checkin was completely rude, insensitive, made me wait... overall the worst experience. i also felt discriminated because my booking was through booking.com otherwise the staff would have behaved properly.breakfast and breakfast staff
negative	Stayed for 3or4 nights every shower was stone cold.Not much
negative	We didn't use the bathroom as it was so horrific it looked like it's been there from the day it was built. Our room smelt musty, two single beds pushed together. Indian wedding took place in the evening which was very noisy -but we were fine with. But then everything was dismantled at 3am right outside our door. So it was a sleepless evening. When we asked night reception about how to get to the Taj they couldn't answer us and then advised us to go to which we knew was the worst gate to go to. There is really nothing good to say about this place avoid it.The restaurant the food was good.
negative	Lack of ski boots dryerSki bus 100m, swimming pool
negative	Everything. The photos were nothing like the 1s on booking.com we didnt even have heating in the room as the heater was broke. Was not happy at all.Wasnt fare from the airport
negative	Complete disaster of a stay,no sleep for 3 nights due to the location and noise of the family rooms above the function and smoking area. Quote: d one price on arrival and charged extra 165 on departure...mistake from staff at reception but ended up paying and leaving so upset over entire stay. Complained letter sent to the manager in regards to the overcharge and no refund. Claming staff member was a junior receptionist and a mistake ...Nothing
negative	The hotel is horrible! All the place is old and very dirty. The walls, the bathroom etc are in tragic condition. We could not sleep at night from noises from the big road in front the hotel. I was to stay 4 nights and stayed 2. The lunch was so cheap and dirty. The low prices are a trap and the photos of the rooms too. Seems that his hotel is a big scam.
negative	Our flight was cancelled and as a result we were charged $150 per room in this supposedly 4 star hotel by a hotel service on the airport. The second night I booked it through booking.com for $40. We arrived in a room where the temperature control was broken and had to sleep in 35 degrees hot room. There were no windows and smoke from the smoking rooms came into the so called ventilation. When asked to change rooms the hotel reception said everything was full, even though the guests in front of us offered us their room at checkout. Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff! The so called technician who, after 3 times asking came to fix the temperature pressed one button and left again without changing anything about the situation. I slept in crowded hostels, tents and even outside on the floor, but this was litterally the worst experience ever in a hotel!Breakfast was the only good thing apart from leaving the hotel again
negative	The hotel very dusty and not clean.. not suitable with family with baby. Picture display and the way the hotel look totally different..The staff was friendly
negative	Room is very small not value of money , bedsheet is dirty , staff is friendly but they always show you black face not smile at all , their breakfast is suckLocation , convenient and shuttle bus provided
negative	The room that was first given to us was extremely dirty. Stained sheets, streaks and stains on the pillow covers which were also torn, lots of mosquitos. The guy at the reception seemed to be taken aback when I said that the room is dirty and asked me a few questions on why I thought so. I then politely told him that I would like to find another place, this made him show me a room which was almost twice as expensive but clean. We stayed there for two nights. The hostel is located on a main road which has vehicles, stray dogs, donkeys and random drunk people passing by with announcements all night long. Also the over all condition of the hostel balconies, common area etc. were covered with a lot of dust. These guys have worked on a nice website and should now get cracking on working on their accommodations.
negative	EVERYTHING! It was a bad experience our stay, the smell was bad, even The couches in the lobby was bad! My worst hotel ever! Don't touch it!The day we left
negative	1 The room was only 4 meters by 4 meters. 2 Some of the staff where not very nice or helpful. 3 TV did not work. 4 No reception after 11pm. 5 Breakfast was poor quality. 6They didn't even provide hangers on the very small cloths wardrobe just over a metre tall. 7 And on the last night they didn't even have toilet paper
negative	Bathroom had a balled up congealed clump of someone else's hair floating around the floor. The 'king' bed was two single beds pushed together disguised by laying a 5-inch thick feather duvet over the mattresses (not ideal to sleep on in 30 degree heat so had to crank the a/c right up to noisy-level). Photos of the view look good online but in reality you will only get a good view if you're on the fifth floor of the five storey building. Everyone else gets a view of the building site across the road which - when completed - will permanently block the good view. Hotel also required a bond deposit even though we offered to pay for the room up front. You either have to let them hold $50 on your credit card (and incur your bank's charges) or give a $150 cash bond (which, in our case left us with very little money to enjoy a meal on our last night). Sadly a very disappointing experience for our last night in NZ.Close to town.
negative	The staff was tough and not helpful until the manager came. The staff isn't fluent in English.the bad quality of the bed (I woke up with a stiffneck) and the noise in the room. The room was next to the lift so all night noise from it disturbed my sleep. The lift was very busy and too slow to come. I will never think it's a 5 stars hotel.The further view was interesting. The breakfast was ok despite the horrible black coffee they serve and the absence of choice for the hot beverage (coffee or tea).
negative	1. I asked for secure private parking in my booking and again on email prior to arrival. and there was none even though it was shown- I was advised by the staff that I could park 400M away in another hotel car park and pay at their desk €12 or €24- depending on location! That was an open-air car park. Not acceptable. The furnishings were made from wood panels and sponge it was like a child's playroom. There was a Dog in the hotel. A noisy, smelling dog - The hotel says "no animals" hence, with having an allergy to animals I booked-it - BUT dog noise and smell! There was an extra €5 / person "Admin Charge" for some reason? I cannot find out why or what this was for? I will not be going back. The hotel mis-represents its facilities and pricesThe Hotel was easy to find The Sauna and steam rooms were good
negative	Weak wifi Poor house keeping Problem in hot water Verry small zised room anf corridors Dirty and old carpet Poor room preparednessExellent location
negative	The room was claustaphobic unhealthily hot, open the window so not to sufficiate and the street noise kept us awake all night The floor boards in the room overhead creeked anytime they were steeped on. On checking out we highlighted the above no interest. I think anyone who stays here complains so the staff have come so used to complaints they don't care. It's a pity that oversea tourists are exposed to places they are doing Ireland such an I service. I am going to contact Failte Ireland about this pre ices alsoCentral location But never again it's not worth not getting a nights sleep
negative	Staff was unfriendly, breakfast menu was good, but there was not enough food. Room service didn't work - we had to ask things three times before they gave service. They have big problems there - there is not aim to service customers. Not friendly at all. It takes 45minutes by metro from Bur Khalifa to Battuta Mall - too long time.The room was quite large. Battuta Mall shopping centre is good.
negative	Room very small, no fridge, no view, the only window is connect to the hallway with stairs where people walk up and down with luggage. Over priced and no breakfast includes unless pay extra. All the photos show in the websites are only the very expensive rooms.Nothing
negative	No hot water in 6th floor. Although it is quiet location, rooster woke me up two mornings in a row at 5 a clock. If you like to stay longer for example 1 to 2 hours they charge you the full price. Compared to other hotel for that cost I would say they can do better. DissapointedLocation is ok, near the city centre.
negative	Lots of noise roosters Booked two two bedrooms Only got one No hot water Tried to charge more than reservation rate Low price Quality so bad we moved after 1 night They were ok with that
negative	These people seemed completely unhappy to have you in their resort . No sign of friendlyness . The shower wasnt working properly The room was full of spiderwebs . Broken tails or over the bathroom . The most idiotic breakfast ive seen . 2 egg , 2 slices of bread with some sample of Jam and i had to pay for my orange juice .Location was nice . Felt like being in the jungle .
negative	The hotel is in a very bad condition. From walls that need serious painting to the blankets that need to be thrown away (yellowish white!)Location Only!
negative	Poor service (limited reception opening hours, no help to book taxi early morning, no towel provided, just one set of keys per room), dirty rooms and bathrooms/toilets (ecological claim is not an excuse for not maintaining the toilets clean, and showers take for ever given the lack of water pressure). Clearly the service and amenities are not up to the price asked, and the nice location does not make up for it.Location close to the tulum ruins and on the beach
negative	It wasn't clean, no services in the room (phone, iron, blow dryer, etc) didn't feel safeThe price
negative	everything. first we arrived and no one opened the doors. so we went to the cafe next door and tried to ring the number, having success after half an hour. the girl who opened the door doesn't seem to be the most friendly person - she seriously looked like she fell out of bed to open the door. very bad impression, but there was worse to come: false advertisment. we do believe this hostel (its nothing more) is an absolute scam. the 4 stars for this hostel? i can't seem to find them. we had to go upstairs to the shared bathroom, which was dirty and mouldy - this is advertised as private bathroom? i had to fix the doorhandle of our room as otherwise we couldn't have closed the door properly. on the top of my bed: a massive hole in the wall for all the cabling - very secure, especially for kids, isn't it? the beds had dodgy looking stains on the sheet, no curtains in our room... i could add way more here, but i'd rather invest my time trying to get my money back.close to the luas
negative	They are cheater I booked a room and they charged rent from my card Immidately at booking , when I reached hotel after a long journey they Said I have no empty room we are already booked . After long waiting they said Will give you money Back and you can go any other hotel .
negative	Far from city center. You have to find taxi. Also if you want to taxi from reception, they are saying different price to same road. I said reception but My room didn't cleaned in three days.Room design
negative	The room we had was without window.and very dirty.we asked a different room and after a while they show us another room on the last floor:beautiful view on the lake but the bathroom was with wc and shower on the top!so small, impossible to go in.so after insisting they show us another room much better. But akways very dirty.so i would not recommend this place at all even if the price was one if the lowest we foundNothing
negative	ELECTRICITY KEPT TURNING OFF, ROOM SERVICE ADDS 22% TO BILL, BREAKFAST WAS VERY LIMITED. HAD TO BEG FOR TOILETRIES DAILY, ARRIVED AND MY ROOM WAS BOOKING OUT! LIMITED WIFI, LIMITED TOWELS OH AND SECURITY KEPT HARASSING ME BECAUSE I'M BLACK! WORST HOTEL STAY EVER!!!I hated this hotel! Wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to stay there! I was thoroughly disappointed the entire time. Even breakfast was amateur
negative	No daily housekeeping and no security safe in room or front counterNothing in order and staff attitude is terrible
negative	not good location, dirty, not facilities, and I wrote an email asking for the invoice because the amount of the payment is different that booking website said and they don´t respond me.the bed was confortable
negative	Horrible, when I arrived the host was very unfriendy. The room was simply discusting! Stains in the sheets, bugs on the floor, everything dirty. Nothing like the pictures on booking.com. I would strongly advise you not to stay here. Left straigt away to a different place!Niets
negative	We have been travelling for 5 months and this was the WORST bed we had stayed In.. the concrete floor would have been comfier. Bathroom smelled, no towels, we paid to have a bath and we didn't get one... receptionist said that it was broken yet we had paid extra for it?! Do yourself a favour and don't stay here, not good value for moneyTv was good and had English speaking channel
negative	Everything. very dirty and rude staff that let themselves into your room whilst you are in bed.Nothing
negative	Everything... horrible toilets, bed was uncomfortable, room had a stale smell, remove control was sticky. Totally horrible.Location if you have a transit as it's an airport hotel.
negative	its look cheaper hotel rate , but when u reach the hotel , they charge for everything , wht make me surprise is the charge 15aed of wifi tht also only for 1 phone .near to the metro station
negative	The room where we received was very cold. Walls being very cold condensation was transformed in rivers at night. Water flowed from the wall over the bed pillows. We woke up with the pillows and bed wet. We decided that we must go even if we paid in advance for 3 days. In the morning we started packing and we found that the loker and its shelves were also wet: all our clothes were wet because the closet had no wooden rear; it was just a facade next to the outer wall. The hotel is located in an area that seems deserted. I do not think this hotel should be open in winter. They are not ready to receive visitors.It was open. The breakfast is good.
negative	My booking was confirmed and I received booking confirmation email from York hotel as well but when i went at reception they said ur booking cancel because of credit card details.... I show them email and confirm status at booking.com app then hotel Manager and reception they said actually we over book and we don't hv any room we will send u to an other hotel it was 1Km from york 1st they ask me to go by walk then i took taxi and reach in Manhattan hotel they charge 40% more then booking price breakfast was included but they don't provide breakfast.. They acomodate only 1 guest but booking for 2 guest.... Totally bad experience with rude & blody management of the hotel. After this story instead of apologize they said do what ever u want to do we we don't hv any room And If u want to complaint against us go-ahead...Nothing at ALL Plzz Dnt book this because of low rate. -3 star hotel
negative	It was an awful experience. I will be contacting you to get a refund. It was false advertising. Mir was not a hotel! It was student accomodation.It was an awful experience. I will be contacting you to get a refund. It was false advertising.
negative	Its a hotel for a solo traveller without any other options. It isn't even for a couple. The staff were not very polite. Indeed when we arrived for breakfast at 9:20 as they close the breakfast at 9:30, staff even after watching us trying to take the food asked us why we are late and continue to cleanup as quickly as she can and doesn't let us take some food for breakfast.One of the staffs who arranged for car parking.
negative	Everything ! The place is horrible and the bed is full of bugs.. i killed all most 10 to 15 cockroach.. discustingWe did not like anything ! It is a terrible place with lots of bugs
negative	Old building, heavy smell all around, split A/C needs maintenance, does not care much about cleanliness.Location is good for old trade neighborhood. Solo travelers might consider for short-stays but you've got to get used to the situation. Wifi okay.
negative	Not valuable for money ... I can only say thisNot valuable for money ... I can only say this
negative	The noise outside was horrendous. It was in a really creepy and dodgy part of Delhi, felt very unsafe walking around. Also, the breakfast wasn't very good. One of the senior staff tried to con my friend and I into spending a lot of money into hiring a private car and driver, plus another wanted to charge us 250 rupees for a 2 minute car drive down to the train station, we settled for a 100 rupee rickshaw ride, even then, it was still expensive, we could have paid 20 rupees. Okay value for money but I would never stay here again.Beds
negative	Temporary tent settlement, very misleading to call the place a hotel. The smell in the room is unbearable cause everything is exposed to humidity, beds and walls are damp.
negative	I didn't like anything, the service was one of the worst I have ever had, the reception staff was unhelpful, they never answer the phone, they don't treat the customer well, you talk to them and they ignore you somehow. Not efficient at all. WIFI was so bad, we didn't have any signal in our room, they promised to fix it but they never did... Even wifi in the lobby is pretty bad.... Food is not good, management is horrible.... OVERPRICED
negative	No hot water, no heater in the rooms, rooms full of dust, bad housekeeping, rooms light sensor goes off every 10 minutes that I have to walk and open then close the bathroom door to have the goes on again. Reception do not answer the calls, housekeeping kept my room open for one full day, front disk charged me 2 times even I told the lady I have already payed for the rooms, three staff promised to open the connected rooms door but they did not came back to me they just ignored me, I have tried for 3 times to meet the on duty manager but every time the staff said he/she is busy, .... This hotel needs major improvement in every thingnothing
negative	Horrible staff, horrible time management they made is change 3 rooms and promised the room will be ready at 2 we went and came back at 4 and it was still not ready. They walked in our room while we were sleeping. Also they take away the key whenever you have to leave the hotel so i dont know how safe it is.Location
negative	Everything elseNothing.. only the location was good.. next to the airport.
negative	The place is extremely run down and I've stayed in better hostels than this for the money's worth ! Staff weren't very helpful at all except for one nice lady which does the morning shift. There are no windows in the rooms and the air conditioner was barely working even when I asked to change rooms and they refused.
negative	New owners beware property is not the same we stayed here before and loved it but since the have the new owners it's not the same staff very in friendly place is dirty will not stay againLiked the river view except the dumpster was right below our room and so was a portapotty they were remodeling the property
negative	It wasn't clean at all. Very dark the rooms and dirty. Is not too close from the French Quarter, so you'll have to take the tram to get there, but there are some bars and restaurants around the zone. The worse is the cleanliness and the bunk beds are in really bad conditions.I didn't like anything of this hostel. The only good thing is that they have kind of a locker room where you can leave your stuff more secure. The staff and the receptionist are nice.
negative	While checking in, the hotel clerk took my card and said he was only charging pre authorization and I said ok, we will pay by 2 cards at check out. 5 min later, he said the charged the full amount. Not honest and not apologetic when I asked to void until check out. The bathroom flooded after taking a shower, even though it has a door. The room smelled like mildew. The receptionist did not care when I mentioned the bathroom floor water at check out.
negative	I did not sleep for a minute. The AC control showed 20 degrees but it was really more like 30 degrees. The room was really poorly maintained and really old. This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, in India. It claims to be a 5 star but all 3 star hotels I have stayed in are way better than Orchid. There was a 20 minute queue to check out full of angry guests! Terribly disappointed with everything at the hotel.Nothing! It was a rather poor hotel.
negative	Terrible cleanliness. Rates were calculated as if it was a real hotel. Actually, It is a residence college rented as hotel during summer season. It Is not a fair advertisement. We had to change to a better hotel in the city, since the facility were not maintained properly. I would expected this service if I was booking through airbnb, where we know the accommodation belongs to someone activly using the property, but not a fake ads... renting as a hotel, while the room belongs to students with low care to the room... koroover management charging that free room to the guests as a 4 star hotel. I will not recommend this accommodation, not even if you want to save few dollars.
negative	I even told the staff about the nasty room and nothing got done still gross the next day ..my father was in hospital I didn't have time to deal with the b.s.I even told the staff about the nasty room and nothing got done still gross the next day ..my father was in hospital I didn't have time to deal with the b.s.
negative	room is small n hot due to sun , plug power point doesn't work, room has terrible view - back of shops n cud see workers smoking away n loitering slow check in process - almost 45 mins!!shower is good
negative	The rooms are awful, stinky and small. Old furniture, decoration, curtains, etc. A hotel with a very bad taste. We booked for four nights but we cancelled it. One night was more than enough! If you can, stay in other hotels in the area. There are plenty!The location is good, beds were okay.
negative	Slow check in and check out Unprofessional staff Very old utilities and furniture After the midnight drunken guys at the lobby throwing words at you and the security doing nothingيسمح بدخول الضيوف
negative	This property was really expensive for what it was. The room was tiny and the man at reception was very unwelcoming. I would not recommend this property.Not a lot.
negative	Too many. Cabin roof is leaking. Woke up in the middle of night having rains pouring on head. Cabin is very dark and bed is not comfortable. No place to even put things down or hang clothes. Only 3 shared hot showers in the entire facility and smells like urine. Water flow is so weak took me almost an hour to get cleaned. Wifi is only available in the lobby and slow as hell. Restaurant next to lobby changes 10 bucks for 5 pieces of bread and they call that continental breakfast. Staff doesn't speak and understand English very well.Close to beach and Tulum ruin. The restaurant on the beach serves decent seafood at reasonable price
negative	Reception,room, and everything . Price for room not worth the condition. Like budget hotel. Should rate 1 star only. Previous stay at boulevard hotel much more convenient. I regret I switch the hotel this time!
negative	It's a hard review to give , When we arrived the booking was made for one person not two and we had pay extra at reception total nightmare , After all that the bed was dirty and no towels in the room , rang reception got moved to different room and that smelled of sick , and window wouldn't open , rang reception again to be told sorry we have no more rooms , Next morning we were late by 6 mins for breakfast and we were told breakfast was over no way would they give us a sausage really pissed me off big time as we had 2 hour drive on Christmas Eve Morning Some of the Staff are very rude . Asked at the bar for food that night to be told we have this we don't sell this what a load crapIt's a hard one because some staff were nice others weren't !!!! The hotel did look very clean and looked nice with Xmas trees
negative	Awful! In Our room, 1039, the TV didn't work, we didn't have hot water even if we had pressed the button to turn it on, we had asked to send someone to solve the problem but nobody came. At the same time we asked for a phone call as alarm in the early morning but nobody called us. Fortunately we put our alarm also. Last but not least the room was full of ants. We asked for a refund cause we paid for services that we didn't receive but they answered that wasn't possible. Really bad experience!!!! At the same price you can definitely find something better! Trust me!Nothing.
negative	Room 142 no heating no tv remote on the half board menu they try charge you for certain items at dinner but it doesn't state that when ordering any where on the menu the staff tell you.you have 20 pound to spend but then give you bill with charges on for ordering different foods one staff tells you one thing other staff tells you another.Gym facility's good
negative	Room too hot moody staff kitchen and cleaning lady. Dirty room shower disgusting nothing like pictures on booking.com. I have stayed here in past many times but room 702 is terrible 202 was manageable but 702 don't bother checking into and really noisy can here room next door clearlyLocation but the staff have been replaced never stay here again. In fact when we checked in they made point saying oh you booked via booking.com like its insult.
negative	This is a decent hotel if you need to be in close proximity to the airport. Otherwise, not a good option. There are really no other services offered by the hotel. We needed recommendations for good restaurants, there was no concierge service. The rooms and beds are extremely small, I was uncomfortable in the room. I ventured off to the lobby and it was drafty and cold. Oh, did I mention there is a fee for parking. When I travel for business I usually stay in an airport hotel and the parking is usually free. I will not return to this hotel.
negative	In the room there was a strong bad smell!Very close to Hagia Sofia Museum and Blue Mosque!
negative	Everything, there was not a toilet seat on the toilet its self,the sink was dirty,The floors were dirty the bed was uncomfortable and dirty everything was horrible, the people above us was really noisy in rhe morning when i went to check out i wanted to speak to them about it all the door was shut and then the man that checked us in came out of the side door and took the key and that was it.
negative	hidden tax included at the end, no free parking, the rooms could be cleaner and repainted, good things were the pool, and the walking access to restaurantsHidden charges was a turn off, they should include all cost with your reservation, they hit you with a very expensive tax at the end, not fair, no free parking, no breakfast, was not happy.
negative	Room was in pathetic state, towels were worn out and stained, taps were broken, bathroom was blocked. Noise especially the vibration from night club was so loud that you need sleeping pill to go to sleep. Vibration was so intense that windows were rattling and the music went on till 2 - 2.30 in the morning. We stayed for 4 days and we could not sleep well even for one night. Would highly recommend NOT to stay in this hotel even if you are offered to stay for FREE.Location of the hotel and reception area ONLY
negative	You should renovate all of you building if you want to open you can not open if it be like this.
negative	Where to start... We had to pay 40usd for a smelly room without window. The staff was awful, no smile, no help, not professional at all. I'm not a very picky person but I had to write a comment on this "hotel". We had to ask few time to have the room prepared, for towels, for soap, for bed sheets... It was dirty and uncomfortable. The reception lady was sleeping behind the desk when we were waiting for the room supplies. Noisy staff early in the morning. Please have a look on the pictures and don't get there! There is plenty of other better place around.Location
negative	I am sorry to say but it doesn't make your stay pretty nice if you get stolen loads (!) of money from a locked room and the staff don't know and can't do anything. Considering the fact that they don't have lockers there they should at least guarantee this kind of safety for a traveller.. I have travelled in quite many places before but I haven't experienced anything like this. I feel bad to say this as the staff was very friendly until the point when I found out about this, after that they were just sitting there and not able to do anything. SeriouslyI cannot say anything good about this because of what happened. You didn't even offer to reimburse me something, poor
negative	It is the worst experience I had, Cleanliness, too bad, even the housekeeping service. I ask for blanket they gave me very old worn one. Bad and old towels. No extra pillow. My reservation was , three bed rooms Apt, They gave me 2 Apt (one bed rooms+1 bed room)Nothing ,
negative	The room is small, furnitures and mattress are old. Not that clean and the water tempreture is not consistent.The hotel is cute! Location is a bit accessible from the metro.
negative	They charge me city en try taxHow they charge city entry charge to mumbai person not fair you said total deal 9990 but they charge all taxes also not good deal sorry
negative	The persons in chargeThere was a lot of noise and the people always seemed to be depressed. Not kind and not helpful. When we wanted to get in again they almost let us in against their will. Bad experience
negative	The noisiest hostel I've ever stayed in. It wasn't possible to sleep at night as the 3 or 4 night clubs round the corner kept playing loud music till 5am. Earplugs didnt really help. In other words, the hostel is loud and dirty, so beware.
negative	The room was very out dated and had a hole in the wall. TV didn't work properly as aerial was not connected properly. Not good value for what we had to pay also had to take a two night booking not a single
