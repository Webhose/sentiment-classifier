positive	歯ブラシ、水無し。部屋は清潔で快適。広々としているのでスーケの開け閉めも困らない。スリッパが有れば良いかな
positive	Sehr schönes Hotel in zentraler Lage. Die Zimmer sind modern eingerichtet und in einem sehr guten Zustand. Auch das Frühstück war sehr gut und das Personal stehts freundlich und hilfsbereit.
positive	I love the Georgian Court. Elegance, comfort, discretion & top notch service throughout!
positive	I went to NYC with my daughter for my bday. We only went for one night stay to attend a live show. As soon as,we arrived to the hotel, the attendant at the front desk ask me if I had reservations and I told him that I did but I'm a little early due to traveling from PA. He immediately looked me up and told me that my room is not ready but he can give me another room if I wish. I told him I would appreciate it very much. He gave me an upgrade to a bigger room and it was a premium suite. Everything after that was awesome too! I will definitely stay there again!
positive	Hotel is very upscale. Right next to Isla Verde beach. The Hotties restaurant net door is excellent. Minutes from old san juan.
positive	Very convenient location; free parking; excellent pool area.
positive	Este hotel é fantástico , tem uma equipe de funcionários espetacular , todos muito educados e atenciosos . Viajei com meu marido e minha filha que passou mal por conta de um sorvete que comeu na cidade . Fomos atendidos e ajudados como se fizéssemos parte da família deles . Tinham carro á disposição no meio da noite para irmos ao hospital , limparam o quarto e trocaram as toalhas de madrugada . A comida dela foi feita especialmente frango cozido com arroz sem gordura, frutas , ... Os funcionários sempre perguntavam se ela estava melhor e se queria alguma coisa . Este hotel 5 estrelas lindíssimo , moderno merecia mais uma estrela pelo carinho com que tratam seus hóspedes . Pretendo voltar e aproveitar o conforto e beleza deste Resort sem falar da comida deliciosa de seus restaurantes e de seus maravilhosos funcionários . Muito obrigada a toda equipe Kamandalu, Flavia Yurtsever
positive	The Hotel is Charming and the staff is welcoming. The room was clean and well appointed. I enjoyed my stay and we have blocked rooms in October for a wedding!
positive	Nice location. Great hotel. Rooms were ready when we arrived. Brought my father for his birthday. Arrived early and was able to check in!! Excellent food. Everything was in walking distance. This was great!!! Can't wait to return.
positive	We have stayed at the Georgian Court several times. It's in a great location-close to Rogers Arena, BC Place and the Granville Ferry. The hotel rooms are very comfortable. Parking is located under the hotel and secured. The staff is quite friendly and helpful.
positive	Very peaceful place because it is off of the strip.
positive	Staff was nice, cldan hotel an breakfast was great.
positive	Only stayed the one night, and could not fault anything. Will book again next time I am going to Singapore.
positive	looking for a nive place to stay while hanging around Downtown Vegas, stay here at the Nugget, comfortable, affordable and awesome.
positive	Hotel is on probably one of the best beaches in Puerto Rico. The staff are friendly and accommodating and the grounds are very well kept. My only complaint is the exceptionally high cost at the restaurants and bars in the hotel.
positive	Beautiful location perfect reception well trained staff good food and relaxing and comfortable rooms
positive	Really enjoyed our stay. Only negative was you have no pool or hot tub unless you pay $20+ for access to the water park. Our group of several 50+ age couples in several rooms had no interest in a water park. Lol
positive	The rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and made our stay enjoyable. They offer shuttle services to wherever you need to go. Would definitely stay there again.
positive	The service we received was Awesome. The person who checked us in was Elaine, from the beginning we received amazing service. The hotel is beautiful, the restaurant on premise was Awesome. It was an upscale sports bar, wonderful ambiance with Flat screens to watch the game.
positive	Das Hotel bietet einen kostenlosen Transfer per Bus zum Disneyland (ca. 7 Min. Fahrt) an, das Foyer und die Restaurants sind neu, stylisch und modern eingerichtet und das Frühstück hat sich für 6 € pro Person extra mehr als gelohnt :-). Die RER Station und das Shopping Center mit angeschlossem Outlet sind gerade einmal 1 Min. zu Fuss entfernt und mit der Pâtisserie Maison Marteau gibt es den besten Bäcker Paris. Wir werden das Hotel für den nächsten Disneyland Besuch wieder buchen.
positive	A great hotel, really enjoyed our stay here. A little far to the beach but the hotel provide shuttles. Overall is great.
positive	Clean room, comfy beds over all great hotel. Easy check in and friendly staff.
positive	Wir waren mit dem Hotel rundum zufrieden. Der Service und die Kellner suchen ihresgleichen - absolut perfekt! Die Zimmer sauber und in absolut gepflegtem Zustand. Hier kann man sich wohlfühlen und bucht beim nächsten Venedigaufenthalt unbedingt das Hotel wieder.
positive	Albergo a 2 minuti dalla metro/stazione ostbahnhof che dista 2 fermate da aleXander platza. Pulitissimo con tutti i confort e in zona tranquilla anche di sera.attenzione la metro s5 e s7 dopo le 22 arrivano solo a aleXander platza e per tornare in hotel da li prendete il treno(comodissimo )hotel consigliato sotto tutti i punti di vista. Non ci aspettavamo un hotel di questo livello
positive	Tout est super...tramway juste en face, nourriture parfaite...très bien insonorisé (même côté rue).
positive	I am in love with this place. The check in was super fast, the staff was lovely, the bar restaurant was chill with yummy food AND THE ROOM! Oh the room was amazing! Big bed with spacious bathroom and the pool was sexy! During this trip I tried 2 different hotels as I wanted to experience this hotel and now I'm obsess so I'm going back on Valentines and I simply can't wait!
positive	A medium sized hotel in the perfect location, close to all the main sites, shopping, bars and restaurants. Easy to get to from the metro stations of Syntagma and Monastiraki. Staff are welcoming, friendly and attentive. There is a good variety on offer for breakfast and the staff keep it well stocked. Tea, coffee and biscuits are on offer during the day and the roof terrace is a must for an excellent daytime and nighttime view of the Acropolis.
positive	Whilst the hotel was showing its age, we enjoyed it immensly. The swimming pools were beautiful, daily buffet breakfast had a fantastic variety, for kids there was even a free dart board or x-box hire for little charge. Walking distant to the beech along the Hilton hotel across the main road where we spotted monkeys, hotel provides free shuttle to the beach which is very clean and sea which has a good visibility for snorkelling. You can find cheap food, cabanas and massages in that spot. Nusa Dua Village offers a range of restaurants with free pick up and drop off for dining customers, just ask! Meter taxi takes customers within Nusa Dua for minimum charge 30,000 rupees or $3 aussie. Laundry in town can be found for as little as $0.50 per kilo and massages for $7-$9 per hour.
positive	Hotel muito agradável, ótima localização e com funcionários atenciosos.
positive	Sono stato in quest hotel 3 notti semplicemente perfetto penso sicuramente il migliore ad Amsterdam personale top tra tutti Lucia che parla italiano una persona gentilissima tutto perfetto cosigliatissimo!!!
positive	Sandy is the Man!!! The best place to go to in the DR.
positive	Excellent location, right in the heart of the city. Most tourist spots are at a walking distance. Free buffet and Free Parking were a great add on.
positive	We stayed at the hotel for two nights. We requested an early ceck in and a sofa bed. We were able to check in around noon, and a sofa bed was much better than others, which made our son happy. Nice to have a mini kitchen also since there is a supermarket within walking distance. They also kept our luggager for few hours after we checked out. It was very nice.
positive	Hotel facilities and amenities were fabulous. Staff is very friendly and accommodation. Luxury hotel. Had a wonderful stay.
positive	Some of the staff members where not so friendly, this lady wanted to charge me $25.00 for having guest over my room which my I say was my 2 little nephews under the age of 10 and my brother which I haven't seen in the past 9 years. But then told me she would charge me for having my brother over. The night staff not so friendly day staff much better. I even had to get my own car. The food was great again the staff during the day was amazing, the night staff not so nice.
positive	L' hotel e' in pieno centro ben tenuto e con del personale disponibile e gentile, unico neo il wi fi in camera va e viene. Per il resto tutto benissimo!
positive	Love this resort, our 10th visit same place. Competition has made them step up their game. Best employees service ever. New, but always changing. Cabo has really grown up the past 12 years.
positive	Nice clean rooms with comfortable beds. Great breakfast, friendly staff. Great value, best rates around.
positive	Absolutely a perfect vacation hotel. Its a short walk to the SUR club and beach. You really will need nothing else.
positive	Very nice hotel. Definitely has a very New Orleans decor, yet a modern feel, Although I did not use the pool. it looked very inviting with it's own courtyard. Nice friendly helpful staff. Always recommending great restaurants and jazz clubs. There is always a cab waiting outside if you need it. Will definitely stay there again
positive	took 4 kids to enjoy a get away and they enjoyed the indoor/outdoor pool and comfortable rooms
positive	The Holiday Inn Express West Ocean City was a truly enjoyable experience. The service was impecable and all the staff were friendly and professional. One great standout was the front desk person, Meghan. She was a delight. she remembered me by name and our previous conversation...last year!!!
positive	Quick check in, nestled in to side of hill, away from the noise of downtown. Updated, clean and quite. Breakfast was good, scrambled eggs, sausage, toast, muffins, juices, cereal, coffee and more. Small breakfast area but not crowded. We were there off season. Taking the Grand Canyon Railway in the morning, so it was perfect for what we needed, 5 min from the depot.
positive	New hotel at very good location. During the stay everything was perfect. Kind and friendly staff, modern and comfort rooms - I warmly recommend this hotel to everyone.
positive	Would very much recomend this facility to friends and realiitives. Complete las vegas gaming and wide variety of dining.
positive	Great experience and staff that were able to assist very well. Jarat at Big Fish kept the kids entertained with his magic tricks. Kochie was excellent also. Location away from everything restricts your dining options, and expensive taxi hinders an otherwise great experience.
positive	I was in Bucyrus for business. The motel was conveniently located.
positive	We enjoyed our holiday at Zara and I strongly recommend Zara for every one looking for a comfortable stay like at home.
positive	A RELAXING HOTEL MINUTES AWAY FROM MADISON SQUARE GARDEN AND TIMES SQUARE.
positive	Have stayed at this hotel on four occasions. They have made pleasant renovations. A new pool with jacuzzi. A Japanese restaurant. Only negative part was that special request for double beds was not honored.
positive	Nice hotel with great staff and a fantastic location. Amenities include tiny pool, tennis court, bar and restaurant. This is our second time back to this hotel. We request the second floor as every room has a view of Eagle Beach. Thank you Ledy for taking care of us again this year, Kevin for making great drinks, and Kristy for arranging our tours.
positive	Beautiful hotel with friendly, attentive staff. Grounds are well groomed and pool bar is a lively place.
positive	Pulito, accogliente, situato in una posizione invidiabile nel cuore di Parigi. Il personale è cortese e fa tutto il possibile per rendere la permanenza gradevole. Lo stabile è antico e ben ristrutturato. La nostra camera era silenziosissima e accogliente.
positive	The Good Nite Inn is a true bargain located in a very accessible area with lots of free parking. The on-ramp and off-ramp for major freeways are right around the block and the San Diego International airport car rental facility is a close 2 miles away. There is a gas station around the corner for a quick fill up. We were delighted to find a huge shopping mall 4 miles from the hotel with a wonderful selection of shops and restaurants. We are planning our next stay here when visiting the beautiful city of San Diego in the near future...thank you Good Nite Inn!!!
positive	Beautiful Hotel adds to the overall Fanta style of a visit to Universal.
positive	Hotel excellent on all counts,only downside is that to reach the beach you have to cross a busy main road,and the fact that the bar and restaurant seemed to be closed most of the time.
positive	Would highly recommend. Very nice place and the rooms are beautiful
positive	Perfect. Excellent room, service and food. I recomend
positive	Sehr praktisch und bequem eingerichtete Zimmer, die für Londoner Verhältnisse groß sind. Die Bäder sind top ausgestattet und großzügig bemessen. Die Lage ist hervorragend, vieles kann fußläufig erreicht werden.
positive	The rooms are updated and new. The bed is comfortable. Don't take a room near the reception. It can get noisy at night.
positive	A quiet, nice hotel at an excellent location close to beach and other things. Friendly staff.
positive	Staff and property are excellent Walking distance to marina, supermarket and everything you need. Good beach. Perfect location. Good food. Well kept.
positive	Great hotel and location. Complimentary wifi and mini bar of softdrinks and juices. Friendly staff and their buffets had a great range whether you have it for breakfast,lunch or dinner. Just off Orchard Rd and close to the Orchard MRT and you could literally walk to that undercover. Few flights of stairs so for people wheeling luggage keep this in mind.
positive	I feel the hotel should allow us to park for the night when we rent a suite. . We were charged 39.50 for parking and we were there 15 hours. Ridiculous price to park!
positive	I would highly recommend this hotel as the staff were friendly accommodating.The room was perfectly kept by the housekeeping staff and they were so pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs.From the concierge to the front desk, these people make for an overall very nice stay!!!
positive	This Best Western was perfect: a nice room, comfortable bed, enjoyable breakfast, and perfect location. I had no complaints and truly enjoyed staying there. Even has a nice exercise room, so will be staying there again on my next business trip to Leesburg!
positive	My family an I enjoyed the all-inclusive at the Paradise Village. The rooms were clean and the staff very helpful and friendly, We also enjoyed the Mexican and Western nights, We liked the breakfast and lunch but the Buffett at night was average, The food was good have been much better for dinner Also the ice cream was not included in the all inclusive package which is surprising, We have gone to many other resorts in Mexico and never come across this as we paid the same as the other resorts, Can ice cream be that costly? really? We were also surprised that there was no selection of good pasta dishes, I would love to come again but would like to see a better dinner buffet as many other guests have told me,
positive	M Resort and Spa Casino is one of those places that will surprise you...No it will knock your socks off! Just a short ride south of the strip, the hotel has great views especially at night of the valley and the strip! Great hotel rooms ( the showers are large walk in units-wonderful), great restaurants, the entry lobby is beautiful! This would be a great place for a company meeting, a family group trip, wedding or just a get away trip without all of the crowds on the strip. I will definitely be back and recommend this Resort to my friend and colleagues.
positive	Everything about this place was meticulous. Food was great, drinks were enjoyable and the pools were very relaxing. Soft music st all pools would be nice.
positive	Great place to stay. We only stayed one night wish we could have stayed longer
positive	Perfect hotel met oude en nieuwe kamers ze zijn de oude kamers allemaal aan het restylen naar de tijd van nu
positive	Had a wonderful Tennis resort & staff's custom service was excellent.
positive	only a few minutes from center of town - price is lower and it's newer and clean !
positive	The closer i got there it made me wonder where did they really put this place. If it wasn't for my research i would've never thought it was worth it. I had the most amazing relaxing time away. This has become my new run away spot!
positive	Only annoyance was how long it took to get hot water in sink unless you ran the shower first....I would recommend the resort to anyone overall 5 stars...all staff were wonderful. Thank you for a wonderful experience
positive	First time in Miami, and this hotel was fantastic. The staff was helpful and inviting. The rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel is close to a secluded beach. But best of all, the skylounge is absolutely wonderful. Just the best place to take a nap midday with a breeze and shade if you need it. We'll most definitely book here again.
positive	Outstanding property. Close to parks, clean, friendly staff, great breakfast. Will definitely stay again.
positive	It was an awesome place to get away and enjoy Maui.
positive	God beliggenhed, tæt på byen. Spaet vi blev lovet var dog under ombygning på besøgstidspunkt, hvilket vi ikke blev oplyst om på forhånd. Morgenmaden var udmærket, og personalet var også virkeligt hjælpsomt
positive	Amazing place. Perfect beaches! Very friendly and helpful staff. The water was very worm and nice. The place is excellent.
positive	位置方便，靜中帶靜，可望Skytree,設備齊全，略嫌殘舊和女性可享溫泉時間太少，,但服務一流，以及安排週到！
positive	The only downside to our stay was the checkin. Our room was not ready at check-in time and were made to wait 40 mins. We were given breakfast vouchers for the inconvenience but I would highly recommend calling prior to check-in to ensure your room is ready.
positive	My husband and I went to celebrate our 20th anniversary. Hotel staff is above and beyond friendly. Resort is beautiful with so many different things to do!
positive	Myself and wife had a great time the piano player was great the staff very helpful great time will be back.
positive	Nothing to complain. Everything was good. Location, breakfast, staff. Will be back!!!
positive	Beautiful hotel on the ocean with a nice beach for sunbathing or walking but no swimming as the undercurrent is strong on this side of the ocean. Very friendly staff who are always ready to help with taxi's or dinner reservations and well kept grounds. Comfortable pool areas with bar service and tasty pina coladas. Lots of fun scheduled activities every day for families. Walking distance to Cabo activities, shopping and dining. I will definitely stay here again when I visit Cabo in the future!
positive	Very friendly & hospitable staff. Nice facility, good breakfast, no complaints
positive	Gorgeous. Worth the trip, very relaxing, great space and wonderful views.
positive	We had a great experience! The kids kept referring to the hotel as "home." It was very comfortable.
positive	When we checked in we thought this was a brand new hotel. After talking with the staff it was reveled that it was over twenty years old but just went through a major face lift. The room we stayed in was absolutely wonderful. If we are out this way again we will definitely stay here.
positive	We were only in town for the weekend, but I wished I had more time to explore the facilities. The view from my window overlooking the fountain and pool was beautiful. Very comfortable bed. Beautiful foyer. Would stay again.
positive	The room had walls of windows. Loved the room and the view!!!
positive	My third time staying here whilst visiting Disneyland Paris. Excellent location and good value for money. Super convenient for the RER rail link with DLP being only one stop and a regular service into Paris. Room clean and clearly well maintained.
positive	Hotel é muito bem localizado. apartamentos bem confortáveis, claros e serviço muito bom.
positive	In the middle of everything. Markets and restaurants near by. Room was spacious and beds were very comfortable.
positive	Great location and tons of parking garage options nearby.
positive	A pleasure to stay here. Convenient location. Room is a good size for my family. Beach is beautiful.
positive	My wife and I were on our 1st honeymoon and was going on a 8 day cruise on the Norwegian Gem. This hotel was a excellent start for our honeymoon. The room was immaculate and staff was great, also the food was delicious. My wife and I plan to visit again.
positive	ビジネス利用で3連泊しました。 部屋は広く快適でした。 また8階のサウナとプールは、非常によかったです。
positive	Cuenta con todos los servicios sin necesidad de desplazarse para disfrutar buenos alimentos y diversión en el mismo sitio. De facil acceso a los sitios a visitar, incluyendo el centro de las Vegas y el aeropuerto
positive	Private villa overlooking the ocean with it's own pool and more square footage than my house. Yeah, felt like king of the world. Great experience.
positive	They really exceeded my expectations. They just need to do a walk around each run to make sure the appliances are working properly. The coffee machine in my room wasn't working. Besides that can't complain. Great staff. Front desk staff from am,pm & overnight make you feel like you're at home. Housekeeping ladies are profesional, cordial and on point. I really wish Ramada don't double charge me for my stay specially after I've paid for it I full thru Expedia... it all got reversed after all but didn't like that at all. But regardless I like the place and would stay again.
positive	This was our second stay at Inn at Sonoma and, once again, it was excellent. The rooms and beds are so comfy and quiet and the breakfast is as good or better than you can get at a restaurant on the Square. The proximity to the Square is perfect for strolling around town, too. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. We'll be back!
positive	Eigentlich können wir uns nur den positiven Bewertugen anschliessen.Wir haben uns von der ersten Minute an sehr wohl gefühlt. Es gibt Sachen für die das Hotel nichts kann zb. die Lautstärke. Eine 5 Millionen Einwohner Metropole schläft nie. Das sollte einem klar sein bevor man Athen besucht. Wir haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen, waren aber froh die Reise nicht im Sommer gemacht zu haben. Ich hatte immer wieder den Eindruck, dass sich die Athener über uns Deutsche gefreut haben.Sogar in der Flughafen-Metro hat uns eine fremde Frau noch einen guten Heimflug gewünscht.
positive	Great stay. Hotel is conveniently located to many amenities, like resturants and stores. Easy access to the highway. Staff was more than helpful with early check in, to allow us time to change clothes to attend a funeral service.
positive	Great close view of the eiffel tower. Rooms are on the smaller side,but it is clean and in new condition
positive	Very friendly staff and best of all was Jared at the beach who made sure we had our chairs under the under the umbrella, plus watched our things.
positive	附近很多很好很漂亮的餐廳，也有幾間很漂亮的咖啡店，酒店旁有一間十分十分漂亮的餐廳酒吧(有蚊)，更有二十四小時開放的7-11 ,鄰近B T S地鐵站，出入方便，酒店坐落商業區感覺安全而且乾淨，星期六日因為不用上班因此人流也十分少感覺很舒服。酒店內酒吧由星期三開放到星期六而已。游泳池有點小，而且有蚊。
positive	We would definitely return. The room was large and clean. The grounds were beautiful and the staff couldn't be more friendly. All the restaurants were very good.
positive	Good location for my purposes. A few restaurants nearby if you want to walk for dinner or get carry out and bring it in.
positive	Great staff in every position, great location, great pool, great beach
positive	Love i . ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ :) :)
positive	Being able to sit and have a drink and smoke a cigarette in a awesome atmosphere eat excellent sushi and even when I had a bit to much to drink I ask for a security escort to my room and they were very kind to assist me the staff were great. Thank you Michael Howard
positive	We had a very quick stay here. We were greeted by Jerry and Steve, shown our room and then we went down the street to the Ocean Spray for a very good supper. We had to get up very early to catch a cab to the airport so didn't even have a chance to have breakfast or say goodbye.
positive	Need a sign in front of the Hotel. Very difficult to find in the snow and in the dark.
positive	We booked the hotel at an excellent rate for London. The hotel's location is in a quiet, very nice neighborhood with a few pubs, diners and small convenience stores in easy walking distance. Several underground stations and Paddington station (convenient for Heathrow!) are also only about 10 minutes by foot. My room had been recently renovated and especially the bathroom was new and very clean. My single room was tiny for American standards but that's what you have to expect in London, especially for that rate. The desk was so small that one could hardly fit a laptop on it, which was a little bit of a problem. The bed was fine. The staff was friendly and very accommodating: we asked if we could leave the rooms an hour later on the last morning and they waved the normal fee for that.
positive	We stayed here as it was close to the Amway Arena. Perfect hotel.
positive	Just spent 3 nights at this lovely hotel. It was clean and modern. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Room had a nespresso machine and a tablet to stream video to the TV. Both a nice touch. Look forward to visiting again.
positive	Hotellet er af virkelig høj standart, alt var perfekt, personale, værelse, omgivelserne, maden, spa, der er intet at sætte en finger på, på dette hotel. Jeg har aldrig været på bedre hotel, ir og med at alt fungerede. Jeg vil klart anbefale dette hotel også til den kræsne kunde....
positive	Love this hotel..Is my 2nd time staying at this hotel. The staff is great , rooms are clean, no hidden fees or parking fees. Parking is small but like most hotels in PR you don't pay to park. Love it, I would definitely stay again!!!
positive	Overall great experience. The hotel is 5 mins from the airport. There are a lot of authentic Puerto Rican restaurants just walking distance from the room. There is even a great night club one hotel over by the name of Brava!
positive	sehr gute Lage vom flughafen direkt ins Hotel ubahn Station befindet sich nur wenige meter entfernt
positive	Great hotel with impeccable customer service. We definitely will stay in this hotel again.
positive	This is our second stay and we highly recommend this hotel. You will feel right at home while staying at this Spanish style inn.
positive	Our family vacation was amazing. Nice room, very friendly and helpful staff. Food was good too, lots of options. My only complaint is for them to inspect the room to make sure everything is working. Our tub faucet was loose, sliding door was hard to open and a tables unbalanced. The staff fixed it fast when notified. Other than that, a great experience.
positive	only negative about the hotel the hallway smelled musty. I did turn the air down only because we were cold then went to dinner came back and the room smelled musty. After we turned it back up smell went away. Room was plent big for 4 people. Breakfast we ok just enough to hold you over.
positive	The hotel staff was very friendly and professional and the check-in extremely pleasant. As we were going on a cruise next morning we had a couple of questions and all of our question were answered very helpfully. The hotel arranged a pick up car and advised on some sight-seeing thing. All in all a very pleasant and nice experience. The rooms are very large, light and clean.
positive	I had a wonderful time at the el conquistador hotel and if I go to Puerto Rico again I will surely without a doubt pick this hotel
positive	Great time. Weather was perfect each day. Front desk was awesome, even delivering a fruit dish one day after golf. Golf course was relatively empty and a good challenge.
positive	This is a fantastic hotel where the accommodation, facilities and staff are second to none. I chose this hotel after weeks of research and reading endless tripadvisor reviews. If you stay here you won't be disappointed. The hotel is opposite the worlds largest mall and the metro which is an excellent way of getting around (easy to navigate, cheap, clean and safe). If you have a chance upgrade your room to a premium, which gives you a great room, free breakfast plus access to a lounge which serves complimentary refreshments all day, plus afternoon tea with patisseries and wine and canapés in the evening. The staff in the lounge are very welcoming and soon get to know you by name together with your drinks preferences etc (how's that for service). The pools, gym, restaurants and bars all excellent. Can't wait to return!
positive	the hotel was perfect for our weekend. the location was perfect close to everything. the rooms were very clean and the view was awesome. The staff was great and accommodated everything we needed including shuttle to several locations because is was too cold to walk.
positive	The only complaint is that housekeeping and mini bar service ifnired the 'do not disturb' sign.
positive	Hospitable greeting checking in after midnight. Clean, comfortable and affordable. Excellent restaurant breakfast.
positive	This facility was not only reasonable in cost but close to everything- just hop a bus outside the door for 1$ Canadian and you are on your way!!! The staff was sooo helpful they gave us a map to direct us in the right direction!!! VERY CLEAN and the pool was great -the morning hot and cold breakfast was nothing but delicious!!!You have costco across the street - just bring your Canadian costco card they except it and get yourself a large pizza to have by the pool was great to watch the sunset!!! The 2 restaurants downstairs next to the lobby is a great choice for meals as well especially The Infusion art caffe OMG makes great food - This was our first stay in Mexico and we are already planing on going back here in April The best vacation ever!!!!The BEST MONEY WE EVER SPENT!!!!
positive	Been here 3 times so far, really great service and very nice rooms
positive	The hotel staff were amazing! They were very accommodating I booked the wrong night by accident and I paid like 20$ less to get a non refundable rate. I showed up at the hotel and they told me that you booked for tomorrow. I called Expedia and they said we wont charge you if the hotel wont. The hotel said why should we charge you. They then switched my day for free. They were really nice and I appreciate it!
positive	Great night for the first class recorded today with my new family website thanks
positive	VERY CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE ROOM. EVERYONE WAS NICE AND SERVED A VERY LARGE BREAKFAST. GREAT COFFEE!
positive	Proche de la plage, petite rue à traverser, très sécuritaire. Coffre fort dans la chambre. Petite penderie avec supports. Petit réfrigérateur caché dans l'armoire. Si cela vous es possible, apportez vous une petite bouilloire et petit grille pain de voyage, pour votre déjeuner. Épicerie superfood a 10 minutes de marche. Restaurant Tulipe, très abordable. Allez visiter l'île, vous pouvez louer une voiture pour être plus libre.
positive	I liked the condition of the rooms which were small, but clean. It has a not quite so popular location on Main Street downtown. It is inexpensive for Las Vegas across the street from Fremont St where there are all sorts of activities with gambling, bars, live music and food at all hours. If you are a young person who just wants to party at a relatively inexpensive price, this is a good place. Food at Oscars is above average, but while the eats at the Hash House are fully up to Mid-west standards, it is bland and overpriced. I actually liked the three smaller in house eateries on the first floor much better at much less cost.
positive	Cracking hotel right in the centre of Dublin, hip on hop off and airport buses stop right outside which made getting around very easy. Staff very friendly and approachable. Lovely breakfast and room clean and modern.
positive	Had a wonderful time, loved the hotel! Great club, nice restaurant, loved the location.
positive	We drove from Cleveland to meet my son's future inlaws on Sat. night The room was extremely clean and comfortable.They stay at the Windham and were not impressed.We will be back soon.
positive	Such a great stay at the InterContinental! Local to the airport, stores & resturants. Right on the beach! Water sports near by. What more can you ask for!? I highly recommend anyone to stay here.
positive	Great hotel and location. Love the food and the people..
positive	Beste hostel waar ik ooit geweest ben, prachtig groot huis met ruime kamers, super schoon. Het ligt vlak bij een supermarkt en openbaar vervoer. De manager Kath doet echt alles om het je naar je zin te maken. Niet meer twijfelen, dit is het juiste hostel....!!!
positive	Fabulosa !!! La disfrutamos mucho y lo recomiendo ampliamente.
positive	Wyndham Grand Rio Mar is a very nice hotel away from the crowds in the city. It's location only 30 minutes from the airport and near the beach and rain forest make it excellent to get away from it all. Clean rooms, nice beach, and three pools provide several options for your stay.
positive	My wife and I stayed at the Intercontinental towards the end of January. Our room was ocean front on the 14th floor and the view was spectacular. We could keep the sliding glass doors open and sleep with the sound of waves very clear. The room was spacious and comfortable. The 3 adjoining restaurants were solid. The grounds are beautifully maintained, the pool area is very nice, and a very nice beach is just steps away. Lounge chairs are free, but umbrellas are $10 per day to rent. In the pool area everything is free. Several excursions are available right from the hotel and an Avis rental car is on site. Last, but not least, the staff were exceptionally friendly. We spoke to folks who come to the Intercontinental consistently for years and the same folks have been employed for a long time. They treat their folks well and it shows. Everyone was pleasant and super helpful.
positive	Loved that night manager called after we got settled to mak sure everything was ok. Unfortunately, there was only 1 serving of coffee (there were 2 of us) and we had to go downstairs ourselves to get it.
positive	We stayed here for a night. It was close to the theatre and the restaurant we were going too. Everyone at the Grand we're friendly and helpful. The breakfast was delicious. A beautiful atmosphere.
positive	Hotel manager very helpful gave me discount for extra night stay - will be going back again
positive	Hotel Molokai is right on the Pacific Ocean, with a restaurant/bar and pool. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I've stayed twice, with a future trip planned. I really enjoy staying there
positive	Made to feel welcome from checking in to checking out. The room was very clean, had everything you needed, comfy bed. The breakfast was very nice, plenty of option which turns into an honesty bar for the rest of the day. Staff were very helpful and polite. Overall a beautiful hotel, will definitely stay there again
positive	Designed for short stays of a few ours between flights and excellent for this purpose.
positive	The staff was great and we couldn't ask for a better experience
positive	If you are looking for a modern, updated place to say, this is not it. If you are looking for a quiet, comfortable, quaint, clean place, this is it! Oh, and FREE parking (which itself is interesting because you have to squeeze into covered parking). This place really epitomizes value. I will definitely stay here again. My only complaint is that I did not have a desk in my room, but I solved that by taking Uber to a 24/7 Starbucks ($14 round trip).
positive	Great value for an amazing place. Very modern, clean, and exactly what my friends and I were looking for.
positive	Best location! You are in the heart of Lahaina and can walk to anything.
positive	We booked this holiday 6 months ago, hotel was fantastic, in a good central location to all the attractions.
positive	The hotel and surroundings are very nice. The staff is excellent. Highly recommended if you want a relaxing stay.
positive	Staff are veer attentive to needs and hotel is located in a great area close to a lot in amenities.
positive	Ticaun Hotel is our favorite hotel when we stay in Tijuana.. very convenient close to places we need to go to on our stay in Tijuana
positive	I spent a great long weekend in Kalima Resorts & Spa with my sister & friend. The over-all service was really excellent! We got a great Deluxe View Room but the size and cleanliness are admirable. We enjoyed the trio pool and the yummy foods in Malika Restaurant. The sunset view and happy hour were the few of our favorites. The sunset view is amazing. I recommend this resort for all types of relationship who wants to spend a great holiday in Phuket. We really had a wonderful time.
positive	Like I said the family lived very close by which this very convenient for them to come over and visit with me and talks about what they being up with there life.
positive	Me ha encantado volveré muy cerca de todo. He podido descansar después de un día agotador de feria.
positive	Nice facility, nice staff - lovely stay. Good location.

positive	Wonderful personnel, very efficient and always helpful. Hotel close to all transportation. Well decorated, nice breakfast. Highly recommended.
positive	Very pleasing. Easy access to airport. Room was very spacious and clean. Nice breakfast buffet in the morning.
positive	We have nothing but good things to say about the Scarlet Huntington. My husband and I were in the city to celebrate my birthday. When staff learned this, they upgraded our room to a beautiful and spacious suite. On top of that, each and every staff member we came into contact with was very welcoming and helpful. Our first time staying at an independent hotel and it was a great choice!
positive	Exceptional customer service; beach took some time to get to but it was a new experience taking a ferry and we ended up enjoying it. Rooms needed a bit updating but didn't mind so much. The only thing I wished for was if the music lounge was a little more lively
positive	Excelente mejor no pudo ser mejor se lo recomiendo a todos
positive	It's a very clean, modern looking and classy hotel. The rooms are of decent size and have a sophisticated feel about it. The service is excellent and staff is friendly. They provide beach chairs and towel as well. Its right in the heart of south beach. Tons of restaurants, bars, lounges at a crawling distance from the hotel.
positive	Hôtel très agréable, chambres grande et calme. Le personnel est juste parfait.
positive	Nice hotel experience. Staff is friendly. Facility is clean.
positive	Wonderful! The hotel was clean, charming, staff was attentive and it had great perks like free tea and coffee in the lobby as well as fresh baked cookies in the evening! I'll definitely be back if I am ever in my Vernon Ohio.
positive	Excellent service, excellent TV service, big room,close to the border, near to auto parts ,gas station and restaurants definitely I will coming back. I like a lot that ia a 100% non smoking so my family and I really appreciate that. The room is clean and smells fresh. I like the extra living room area, the mini appliances and beds. I will recommend it!
positive	Shuttle to pier was fast and on time.Hotel staff were pleasant .Hotel was a little hard to locate for Uber driver.Is address correct?
positive	Very friendly and hospitable country, found people to be very genuine. Plenty to do while vacationing.
positive	Our room was clean and comfortable. We just stayed the night. We didn't leave the room to see the sights. Then we left for a cruise in the morning.
positive	This hotel is in a great area. It is very convenient and in walking distance to anything you need.
positive	the staff and the hotel could not have been better. Excellent, friendly, very helpful. Would I stay there again, very much so.
positive	This was my first stay at the Lafayette Hotel. The location is great - I was able to walk to many different places. The hotel is an older hotel, but I found it to be very charming. I loved my room! It was very spacious and clean, the bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful - particularly the bellmen/women. The staff went out of their way to make my stay pleasant and successful. I would stay here again.
positive	Tolles Hotel direkt an der Rambla in Barcelona. Ideal gelegen um von dort aus Barcelona zu entdecken oder richtig gut einzukaufen :)
positive	Very beautiful. Very clean . We went in the pool and hot tub and had the buffet breakfast. All was great and I would go there again
positive	This is a great hotel in a perfect location right in the middle of Soho. The location is great because it's just behind the main areas so there were no noise issues at all. The room has a small kitchenette with a microwave and nespresso machine, sink and fridge, which was great if we didn't want to eat out. Room was small, which is normal for London and was clean with modern decor. We walked out the front of the hotel and around the corner to Theaters and the awesome cafes. Tube stations are also not far to walk. Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square stations are close and we walked to Leicester Square and caught the train directly to Heathrow when we left. Would stay there again.
positive	Only a short walk from Retiro, easy on Metro from airport
positive	Great hotel , I m love it and price is cheap , I will be back again
positive	My room was on Lombard street so it was noisy but drowned out by my in room A C system. Shower pressure should be improved. Overall a great deal. Safe secure clean comfortable great value for the money I would stay again and recommend it to all
positive	Beautiful hotel with great amenities. Great for stop over on way to cruise ship. Should have stayed longer. Lots to see and do. Pool, beach...Exceptional. Food costs too high however. Much like every great hotel. Totally recommend this hotel.
positive	Wonderfull resort. We had very nice stay and super relaxed vacation. Food choice was excelent and always fresh. Hope to come back soon.
positive	Right downtown and super close to Vatican. Small boutique hotel, only 10 rooms, but for the price, it's prefect. Wifi not the best so if you need speed and have to do a lot of work... maybe not the best place. Otherwise it's fine. They have breakfast onsite but if you want to find a local coffee shop, track down a place called Parenti. It's a couple blocks away and their cappuccinos are to die for. Trust Marco at the front desk, he didn't steer us wrong once...it was like having a personal tour guide and he helped us find our way to the metro which we took to the coliseum. Was pretty easy and cheap! We ate dinner one night a Da Vito e Dina. ....1.5 blocks from Tango. (Also suggested by Marco), it was fantastic. Had the mushroom (funghi) pizza and the gnocchi and a litre of house wine which for the price, also awesome. Both menu choices were one of the best meals we had all week in rome. Simple but excellent!
positive	I was the mother of the bride and arrived at the hotel forgetting to bring my speech along with me. The front desk person was very accommodating and spent time helping me print out the speech - this was very important to me and it was very much appreciated. She worked at this whilst deftly accommodating her other patrons and everyone was well served in a polite and professional manner.
positive	Amazing hotel, extremely clean and hotel staff were very helpful. Room was equipped with everything, including a European convertor! Huge space for a euro hotel. Will definitely stay here again next time in Prague. Total class!
positive	I loved this hotel. It was beautifully updated with New orleans flare. The hotel was in a great location in the French Quarter, everything was in walking distance. Bourbon street and canal St both 1 block away. I wasn't crazy about the restaurant, my breakfast was horrible but there are plenty other places to eat. I plan to return to new Orleans and plan to stay at this same hotel.
positive	We loved the hotel the second we walked in. We were greeted by amazing staff, and out check in was quick! We were handed out room keys in less than 5 mins. Once we got in our room it was clean and very spacious! We loved everything! We would definitely stay here again!
positive	The staff was welcoming, the room was clean and comfortable. The most memorable part of the stay was the great food in the Pub and the friendly bartender. We booked the room to ski at Whiteface Mountain. The hotel is just a five minute drive and skiing there was terrific. The Hingry Trout is a great value and I would definitely return.
positive	Trots närheten till flyget märer man det inte inomhus.
positive	유니온스퀘어에 바로 인접하여 도심, 해안, 다른 관광지까지 모두 교통이 편리하고 접근성이 좋습니다. 유서깊은 호텔이라 클래식한 느낌도 나면서 최근 리모델링으로 깨끗하고 사용에 불편이 없습니다. 추천합니다.
positive	Hotel bem localizado, atendimento super simpático, acomodações novas e ótimas. Super recomendo.
positive	We had a nice time in the snow and played many games with the chrildren. My whole family came for the inauguration and we had a chance to see donald trump up close and petsonal
positive	It was nice. Everything went fine, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and had good hot breakfast
positive	The room was comfortable and spacious. I really liked that there was a fridge and sink. They also supply robes and slippers for your trip to the rooftop hot tubs or the gym. I got a free drink card, which was a nice surprise. And, the complimentary breakfast is terrific.
positive	Had a great birthday weekend at the Park Grand Paddington Court which was made even better when we got back from dinner to find a piece of delicious birthday cake and an amusing folded towel birthday cake display, i have to commend the staff because we never mentioned we were celebrating anything and its little touches like this that make trips away special
positive	Friendly and warm welcome. Staff could not have been more helpful. After staying in the Hilton Kensington which cost substantially more - the carpets were stained and the room was tired. Arriving at Hyde Park Boutique Hotel was like a breath of fresh air.
positive	Is very good hotel. Attention goog Cleaning good I recomended for vacations
positive	We were there for a Canucks game and it is literally across the street from Rogers Arena. Lots of great places to eat and shop near by and the staff was very helpful and nice. They have a Jacuzzi and steam room that we really enjoyed also. Will stay there again for sure.
positive	We had an enjoyable stay here even though the king size bed we booked through Expedia was not available and we ended up with a room with two beds. Expedia shouldn't offer what they can't deliver and I hope I didn't pay extra! That would not make me very happy. Otherwise, the pool area is nice. There are two hot tubs, a kiddie pool and a large pool with slide. The best thing is the convenience of getting to each park or to Disney Springs. Buses come about every 20 minutes and there is a boat to Magic Kingdom. Staff were all friendly except for an attitude I detected from Marie over the room not being a king. I felt like they didn't want to do much since the room was not booked directly through Disney. She did offer a villa room eventually but my husband likes the lodge. The breakfast was good at the lobby restaurant but you really need reservations. Otherwise, the canteen style was also good for quick style food and the cashier was really nice there.
positive	Wonderful hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. Spacious room with canal view, and the free minibar in the room is a nice touch! The staff are friendly and were very helpful in pointing out some places to go. The hotel is walking distance to Rijksmuseum, flower market, central station, and there are plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby.
positive	Lovely staff. Room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel was a very good location and easy to find.
positive	It's not luxurious like many other Vegas hotels but it was clean and comfortable. The rooms were also pretty quiet
positive	Zeer vriendelijke en warme ontvangst bij aankomst. Als "repeater" een mooie upgrade gekregen. Zeer vriendelijk gemotiveerd personeel wat ook tot uiting komt in het geringe verloop (veel personeelsleden waren er ook al toen wij vijf jaar geleden voor de eerste keer kwamen). Kamer werd iedere dag uitstekend hygienisch schoongemaakt. Op laatste dag ongevraagd aangeboden gekregen om kamer tot vertrek (avondvlucht) te kunnen houden zodat van de laatste dag volop genoten kon worden. Een aanrader!
positive	Une équipe très efficace, professionnelle et symphatique. Un décor très chaleureux. Un emplacement idéal. Un tarif attractif. Tous les ingrédients pour réussir son séjour dans la capitale...
positive	Good location,nice pool and garden, comfy room! Very good stay, recommended!
positive	Beautiful place. Unique. Big shower. Comfortable bed.
positive	Fijn hotel. Fijn personeel, vriendelijk en ik voelde me thuis
positive	Nothing to complain about. Great staff and service!!!
positive	Location is perfect - right on Eagle Beach. Easy to get to downtown as well as Palm Beach. Staff is very friendly. Also large grocery store nearby to get all your supplies for your stay.
positive	Nice and comfy. Would recommend to friends and family
positive	Great resort, very child-friendly. Staff was also very helpful. On the quieter side so great for just relaxing. The gym is excellent. There are a number of pools for kids and a great main pool (where they keep the water nice and warm). There are 7 restaurants on the property so you willl have a lot of options for food. If you want a quiet, relaxing holiday at a great resort, this is your spot!
positive	Our stay at Marival was definitely one to remember... we already can't wait to go back! The kids club was far above and beyond my expectations. The activities staff were amazing as well. So many personal touches that made this vacation bar none- one of our best ones yet.
positive	Close to shopping returants, and other activities. Also right off the expressway
positive	Awesome .. I'll recommend all my friends stay there when visiting San Diego
positive	This is my third time at this hotel and I keep returning mainly because the location it's right on the beach, the rooms are lovely and the facilities are perfect to relax and enjoy. However they need to hire more staff. During my check in I literally had a guy next to me arguing with the front desk person about his suitcase taken to a different room and at the same time she proceed to share all my personal information out loud without any regard for my privacy or safety. Other than that I truly love this hotel. The bartender still remember us and we got to take the same picture from last year. The food is yummy the drinks are amazing and the view from the room is breathtaking and we got breakfast in bed
positive	Convenient to town stores. Clean and cozy. Free breakfast was very good with a cool pancake machine!
positive	We walked on the beach, relaxed on the lanai, and had a great dinner at the Hana ranch. It was a perfect stopping point on our trip around the island. We were traveling with our adult son, and the one bedroom unit worked perfectly. It was made up and ready for three people which was great.
positive	Staying at the Sutton Place Hotel is already a treat. Staying in their La Grande Residence is another level of luxury. We reserved the 1 bedroom modern suite and were upgraded to a two bedroom. Wished we invited a couple more friends to stay with us! The room service is prompt, reasonably priced and delicious! It's going to be hard to stay in anything less.
positive	I was in Toronto for a conference. The staff were amazing, Jennifer and Nicholas at the front desk and Joyce in the restaurant. Helpful, pleasant and a great experience.
positive	We had a very pleasant stay, the staf very helpful, it was as expected by description on the web. We had a very exceptional stay and we recommend, it's a good choice.
positive	Good location. Close to Penn station. Easy to get around New York
positive	Another great stay, great location and will be back again
positive	We went for the travel show. I am a travel agent, and review all my stays at hotels. This hotel was wonderful. I basically look for cleanliness, and it was amazing. Comfortable bed, great extra touches. I would recommend this to anyone.
positive	Nice, quiet hotel just outside of the town of Ubud. We stayed in one of the bungalow units. Lots of space inside including a huge bathroom with a large sunken tub. Very private yard area that includes an awesome outdoor shower surrounded by plants. Many units also include a small, private pool. The spa facility is excellent. I had the best four-hand massage. The women really knew what they were doing. We'll trained. In sync with each other. My wife had the foot massage. She also said it was the best ever and she has had quite a few all over the world.
positive	We stopped here overnight on a long-distance drive and were very pleased. No frills, but everything in great condition. Room was comfortable, building was quiet, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a little lacking in variety but otherwise everything was great.
positive	It was a quaint hotel...completely non standard with regards to the construction style, garage, lobby, room wall finish and decor. The mattress in the main bed was very good while the one in the pull out sofa was terrible. The shuttle to the condonado beach was good. Breakfast was excellent. It all depends on the price for which you buy this room. I wouldn't call these rooms luxury...but they are pretty good.
positive	Hotel is very good plenty of choices for breakfast Rooms are very clean beds are changed every day including towns close to Sky train staff at the hotel and very helpful Wi-Fi is good as well
positive	우리방이 패밀리룸 이었는데, 2층외에는 없는것같아 방위치 교환이 안되었다 그리고 바로 창문앞에서 신축공사가 있었기 때문에 소음이 다소 심했다 그런데도 전반적인 호텔시설이나 서비스는 좋았음. 뉴욕의 물가지수 대비해서는 적정한 가격에 숙박료를 지불한것 같음 가족여행에는 적극적으로 추천함
positive	we stayed here this last week and found everything was excellent. We arrived well before the 3pm first access time due to our early flight but nothing was too much trouble and we were allocated our room straightaway. Large room with very comforatble furnishings and well equipped modern bathroom. We had chosen to have breakfast at the hotel and found the buffet breakfast excellent with a really wide choice and very attentive staff.
positive	Close to a conference. Great staff in hotel and restaurant. Room is a bit tired but clean.
positive	Clean hotel & staffs are very kind location is ok too
positive	Muy buen hotel, areas limpias y amplio parqueo. Se encuentra cerca de restaurantes.
positive	Very nice apartment building. We had a great stay. Location is super, close to many restaurants and the beach.
positive	Casino rugs was a bit old looking and needs new ones
positive	This was our third visit to this HGI hotel. I often seek out Hilton family hotels and this one does not disappoint. Friendly staff, clean, comfortable rooms. Near restaurants and the interstate on the NW side of Findlay.
positive	Very comfortable, health oriented and sparkling new hotel next to Penn Station and multiple restaurants in nearby Hell's Kitchen - near Times Square but not annoyingly in the middle of it.
positive	It's an unforgettable experience here.The hotel condition is good, as well the owner is so kind and helpful. He told us how to have fun in Barranquitas, so we spent a wonderful day in this little town. My mother left her phone charge when we departed. The owner found and called me immediately. Thanks so much!
positive	Very friendly staff. Breakfast was well prepared and nice fresh selection.
positive	Very nice hotel. We went in January when it is sort of cold and therefore did not get to enjoy the roof top pool. But overall very nice.
positive	We had a great experience at Cabo Azul. There is nothing bad we could say about the place. Facilities, staff, amenities were all perfect. If you can't get fired up about staying at this place your wood is wet! Great place.
positive	I had a very nice time. The buffet was everything. The hotel is everything
positive	靠近JR車站,24小時便利店,非常方便旅客前往和購買所需的物品,例如水,零食。而且附近有不少的餐廳,甚至有24小時營業的餐廳,對於玩得很晚,又沒吃飯的人而言是很方便。房間不太大,但因為只是用來睡覺,所以影響不大。
positive	The doormen were our first contacts, and all of our comings and goings were met with smiles, kind words and held doors. The lobby is small, comfy and efficient. Lots of rock 'n roll books to peruse, comfy 60s era furniture, and a corner where daily breakfast pickings are set up. Later in the day there's a basket of twinkles too! Staff very helpful, though we didn't need much help. Eclectic selection of well loved LPs to borrow, because you have a record player in your room. We listened to Bob Dylan, 3 Dog Night, early (they're all early) Billy Joel, and Charles Aznavour. Very clean, shower big, towels and bed linens plush and soft (no crappy postage stamp towels or thin bedding here!). Next time might ask for a couple extra pillows. Only thing, could've used a place to hang our coats it was January. Only place for hangers was way too short. Will DEFINITELY return.
positive	Very clean, modern look, great breakfast, really nice rooms.
positive	Copley House was a unique and convenient hotel experience. We will definitely be returning for any of our future overnight Boston adventures!
positive	Great hotel, clean, friendly staff, and near everything.
positive	Absolutely beautiful. Great location near restaurants, pharmacies, beach etc. Steps away from the beach. Beautiful pools. Friendly staff. Good food. Clean, quiet, functional, lux rooms. Beautiful views. We will definitely recommend and visit again.
positive	We requested a standard suite and, upon arrival, was upgraded two levels above. The staff was friendly, extremely courteous, willing to assist in every possible way. We definitely plan to return again next year.
positive	Many nice stores including Starbucks and a nearby supermarket.
positive	The hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the resort was clean and updated. The pools were in great condition and the beach was well preserved and maintained. It was both a couples and family location and never felt too crowded. The food was good but a bit expensive and not all the restaurants were open every day, but there was availability. Would definitely go back because of location, accommodations, views and staff.
positive	Nice boutique hotel. Room was very large with a sofa and sitting area. Good location - right across the road from the beach. Staff was nice and helpful. Breakfast buffet was expensive.
positive	最高の立地、お部屋からの眺め、快適に過ごせる部屋の設備、気楽さ、最高でした。 私たちは３階のお部屋でオーナーさんが良かったのか、部屋の設備が最高でした。 エアコンが無かったので心配でしたが、天井についているファンが心地良く、過ごしやすさを追求したお部屋の設備が素晴らしい。全てのものが快適に過ごすため工夫されていました。キーレスだったり、変にベッドメイキングが入らないところも良かったです。宿泊が１2月24～だったのでクリスマスに当たり、従業員が一人もおらずという状況に戸惑いましたが何一つ不便が無く過ごす事が出来ました。 お部屋により設備は若干異なるかもしれません。 従業員がいらっしゃらなかったのでホテルの従業員のところの評点を３にしています。
positive	Surprise trip for my wife as part of her b'day celebrations. From start to finish a fantastic experience Hotel staff were wonderful and extremely helpful. I would recommend this and will be returning.
positive	Room was far away from front door and front door was nice little walk from bus. We are elderly so that was tough. Drink machines - had a hard time finding one that had drinks in it.
positive	I was very impressed by this hotel. Check in was fast and was also offered a complimentary newspaper. The buffet was very cheap but quality tasty food. This hotel made hotel security a high priority. The room was updated, roomy and clean. Hotel staff was very accommodating. The casino seemed filled with a lot of Vegas residents customers.
positive	Would definitely recommend this hotel friendly staff very helpful, location was great.
positive	Waiting staff were all very nice but service was on the slower side. I guess when you're on island time it's all good!
positive	The only issue was that some rooms had mold smell. Everything else was great, rooms clean and comfortable, staff friendly and helpful. Good location.
positive	Awesome time, great place, friendly & helpful staff. Great bar and staff. Will book here again. My family really enjoyed this place
positive	A first class facility w/ very friendly staff. Everything was great except for the restaurant food which was mediocre and very expensive.
positive	Absolutely beautiful hotel!! Very comfortable, clean, quiet. A treat for all!
positive	Extremely relaxing, pleasant and luxurious. North of busier Miami hotels and nightlife, but easily accessible. Has a spa, and pools on rooftop as well as on grounds. Tremendous variety of things to do nearby for both families and couples.
positive	We stayed here for 3 nights January 2017 as had booked tickets to the Mercedes Benz arena to see Green Day. After the concert ended , we left with 17,000 people, caught a train and were back in the hotel within 30 minutes - amazing. Location was handy for the express airport train. 5 minutes walk to Alexanderplatz transport hub. Bar was lovely for a final drink in the evening, reception staff polite and helpful. The room was great. Only criticism is that the bathroom bedroom are separated by a glass wall which is only partially covered by a picture. This meant the bedroom was fully illuminated when husband went to loo in the middle of the night.
positive	A great experience .. and a lovely place to stay at.
positive	We were greeted with a rumpunch and warm smile. Hotel staff was great.
positive	We have family in Vancouver and visit frequently. I choose this hotel after our old standby disappointed us during our last trip. we will definitely continue to choose this hotel as it ticks off all the important requirements for our stay: location, cleanliness and comfort, free strong wifi, mini fridge etc. The free amenities in our room we're the absolute best I have ever experienced: Nespresso coffee, free water bottles, bathrobes, slippers, feminine products, hair dryer, flat iron, hot curler, cotton pads, lighted makeup mirror, safe, quality toiletries etc. I've uploaded some pics to give you an idea. Staff was great, neighborhood convenient to restaurants and shopping. Due to booking on Expedia we were upgraded to king deluxe suites on both of our stays. Fabulous all around!
positive	Excelente hotel but if you are from south america is a prolem , mainly if you are from Brazil. Brazilians wear clothes diferent from there and all the time you are discriminated. The employers all the time ask you if you are at the hotel and don t ask it from other nationality. Incredible. It is a wonderfull hotel but they discriminate some nationity. It was my second time there and I don t know if I will return.
positive	Complimentary breakfast was great. Room was clean. Facility was easy to get to. Plenty of parking.
positive	The loud music everywhere you go on the property was annoying, but you get use to it. The adult only pool is amazing and fun. The food is outstanding...bring a set of bigger pants! It was surprisingly expensive to eat and play, but overall, a great place to be!
positive	Love this small hotel with elegant decor. Although the room is a little small, we had an enjoyable stay. Breakfast was good, all the food items are in exceptional quality, the orange juice is freshly squeezed, the baguette fresh and crunchy, the ham, coffee, etc, we live the selections. Will definitely consider Hotel Louison again next time going to Paris.
positive	Great hotel! Central location. Not on the beach, but that's ok- They make up for it in the amenities. Our favorite was the complementary, made-to-order breakfast. Also liked the rooftop pool. When we come back to San Juan again, we will definitely be staying here!
positive	great hotel which is close to restaurants and public transportation. Perfect for a short stay in Sydney
positive	L'établissement est très bien situé (centre-ville). Les personnels, vraiment agréables. Ma chambre était plus que confortable et bien entretenue.
positive	Had a great time, perfect weather, nice to get away from the snow and ice
positive	Not one thing was missing. We stayed two nights, had booked two rooms and everything was great with both! Can't wait to return.
positive	Great spot for a getaway to Vancouver. We put the car away in the valet parking and walked to many of the great spots the city offers. Brunch at The Elbow room; a walk to English Bay; shopping on Robson Street; dinner at The Greek by Anatolia in Yaletown. Doesn't get better than this!
positive	Will check in again to this hotel when I come back...
positive	Great little hotel right off the interstate and incredibly affordable. Bed was super comfortable. Breakfast was amazing. Staff was fantastic. I would definitely stay here again.
positive	HOTEL A DUE PASSI DAL CENTRO. CONSIGLIATISSIMO C'è STATA ASSEGNATA UNA CAMERA CON TERRAZZA .. STUPENDA.. SFRUTTATA POCO SOLAMENTE Perché ERA GENNAIO. CAMERA OTTIMA CON TUTTI GLI OPTIONAL DEGNO DI UN 4 STELLE. UNICHE PECCHE: PORTA DEL BAGNO CON UN PEZZO A VETRO.(POCA PRIVACY) NELLA TERRAZZA C'ERA ANCORA IL POSACENERE CON CICCHE DI SIGARETTE DEGLI OSPITI PRECEDENTI..(PULITE IL GIORNO DOPO).. UNA DIMENTICANZA ACCETTABILE.
positive	飯店地點交通便利，離港鐵公車都很近，附近小吃也多，重點是房間比想像中大多了，兩張單人床，還有空間可以將大行李箱攤開放平，非常棒的飯店，唯一缺點是網路不夠強，不好連結上網。
positive	Excellent hotel and staff. The full breakfast is noteworthy. Overall a great value. I will be staying here again.
positive	Built about three years ago, 8 rooms per floor, surrounded by florist wholesalers. Clean, compact, and a comfortable bed. The four of us (two adults, two teenagers) in a room with two queen beds were snug but not cramped. The floor was a cushioned laminate and not carpeted.
positive	Explored Ubud, relaxed, resort perfect. Enjoyed free yoga
positive	Nice, spacious, clean rooms. Good breakfast. Friendly staff.
positive	Sehr coole Ausstattung, spitzen Frühstücks Büfett und alles zu Fu zu erreichen. Sehr hilfreiches und nettes Personal.
positive	We found this hotel by chance while searching for affordable boutique hotels in Paris on the net. We were pleasantly surprised to see how cute and cozy it is! The decor gives it a unique character and the staff are super helpful. It's a short walking distance from a lot of landmarks and also close to the metro and bus stations. It's definitely a "happy culture" experience!
positive	Nice hotel, fair price. Beautiful pool and deck with cheap drinks and tasty included breakfast outdoors overlooking the marina. Close to bars and restaurants, can walk to Medano Beach. The design layout of the hotel is strange, very long and narrow (probably to maximize ocean view rooms), takes a long time to walk from some of the rooms to pool and common areas.
positive	Best location and quiet. You can get to most amenities in the French Quarter.
positive	I arrived late and getting an early check in was a breeze. Thanks rl the expedia staff. Plus with the 25% off coupon makes it totally awesome Experience.
positive	We had a great experience. This is a high end hotel with ambience and comfort. Will definitely return for future get-always!
positive	Staff are beyond exceptional. Room was very clean and comfortable. Overall great stay!
positive	Nice hotel, very clean, next to sea world, varied and good breakfast, quick check in.. Wendy's is right in the front.
positive	Great place, food, staff, close to many restaurants.. Would stay again if ever in the area
positive	Perfect Hotel close to everything, shopping, Darling Harbour, China Town. So many things to do. Checking in was a breeze, the staff were excellent, lovely rooms and quite. Would recommend staying here and would stay here again.
positive	Malgré une arrivée tardive après 12PM nous avons été très bien reçu chambre très confortable
positive	The room was clean and quiet. We enjoyed the comp. breakfast and the staff were pleasant and helpful.
positive	Rooms are so nice. Very modern, large rooms. Good price! Staff is nice.
positive	Really good area for shopping and walk also for transportation
positive	The room and grounds were nice. Location was the key. Off the beach, but close enough and also walking distance to shops and food. Definitely planning on going again
positive	Great stay, wonderful hotel, loved the buffet breakfast, very friendly and professional staff, clean and spacious room.
positive	Was a really lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff. Hotel was located with easy access to most places.
positive	This is a beautiful new hotel with spacious, landscaped grounds and extremely comfortable rooms. Breakfast is top rate. Pool access rooms are perfect for privacy and convenience. The hotel is very close to the airport, but does not suffer from aircraft noise. Staff are thorough and helpful. Two restaurants and bar serve high quality, reliable food with ample choice. We enjoyed our stay immensely.
positive	마드리드에서 2박했는데 매우 만족스러웠습니다. 비수기라 가격이 저렴하긴 했지만, 가격대비 만족도가 매우 높았던 숙소였습니다. 아토차 렌페/지하철역 바로 앞에 있어서 바르셀로나와 톨레도를 오가기 매우 편리했어요. 룸 컨디션이나 인테리어 등도 보시는 사진 그대로입니다. 다만 리셉션 오픈 시간이 짧고, 욕실에 욕조가 없고 다소 비좁다는 점은 아쉬웠습니다. 다음번에 마드리드를 또 방문하면 다시 이용할 계획입니다.
positive	Nice and clean hotel. Good location, walking distance from old town.
positive	Great hotel staff are very friendly very family orientated
positive	Excellent hotel whose staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had been here before and enjoyed the hospitality then and encountered the same high standard this time round. We find that this hotel couldn't be beaten not only due to the staff but it is in a great location right in the heart of the city where everything is within walking distance.
positive	Excellent hotel for price. Nice breakfast included too!
positive	Brand new, very modern, direct access to the beach, great rooftop with pools
positive	広州東駅前なので、交通アクセス良好です。自分は香港から鉄道で移動して来たのですが、駅からホテルまで歩いてたどり着けました。また、ファミマが一階に併設(2017/2時点)されています。駅のショッピングモールへ行けば、フードコートがあるので食事も便利でした。値段が安めの割に便利なホテルでした。
positive	Muy limpio, la estación del tranvia y el Bus a una calle. Aqui te ahorras la renta del coche, puedes moverte a cualquier parte de San Diego comprando una tarjeta de transporte. Además el desayuno excelente, toda la atención del personal es muy atenta. Si vas de compras hay un Mall a dos estaciones del Trolley o puedes ir hasta el centro de San Diego. Este hotel esta super bien comunicado.
positive	Great hotel with friendly staff, we arrived close to midnight and front desk was so friendly and helpful. Room was spacious and bed comfy. We stayed for a week and was made to feel welcome for our entire stay. Surprised how close it was too most sights. We didn't eat in the hotel as I took 2 teenagers with me and we all know teens can be fussy. Plenty of places to eat close by at reasonable prices. Would definitely stay here again.
positive	You can take the boat right to the opera house for $7.
positive	My family and I have stayed here twice already and each time we love our stay. Friendly staff n very updated decor.
positive	Comfortable stay. Me and my boyfriend it was His birthday and he felt like a king. It was lovely love the bed and furniture. Love the bistro pub and late night snacks. Pool looked clean and amazing. Quiet stay no disturbances
positive	Personally I thought internet connection can be offer. Competition on a lower level hotel does. Why not the M resort ? Over all, good.
positive	My family of 4 spent ~ 2 weeks at the Zara over the holidays. Had 2 bedroom apartment that was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful at the drop of a hat.. The complex is perfectly located on the fringe of the Sydney CBD, and < 1 km from Central Station, from which you can get anywhere you want to go. We loved staying there and were sorry to leave. We recommend it highly.
positive	Beautiful hotel and wonderful staffs in a breath taking forest. Eat Pray Love!
positive	We had a great stay at Pallazo Magnani Feroni. It is a suites hotel only 13-14 rooms. Very spacious and friendly, helpful staff. It is located on the south side of the Arno River, but central Florence is walking distance. Great breakfasts and a roof top terrace with a great view of Florence.
positive	We were in town for my nieces funeral. Hotel was easy to find. It was very clean and smelled good. All the staff was very helpful and friendly.
positive	This hotel room was located next to a police station so it felt very safe. I stayed with my best friend and sister and three girls sharing a bathroom can be crazy but the was more than enough space for us. Everything was comfortable and fairly clean. The man at the front desk (Andres) went above and beyond with everything we asked him about. We weren't sure where to stay for our second night in New York and when we rebooked he helped us with a very smooth transition. Everyone else was also pretty helpful and the stay was enjoyable and fun! Please keep hiring awesome staff that make guests feel like close friends and help them to explore the concrete jungle. ~Rae
positive	여기저기 다니면서 쇼핑하기도 편리하고 주변에 편의 시설이 다 갖추어져 있어서 지내기 매우 좋았습니다 가족들과 짧은 여정의 여행이었지만 여유롭게 시간을 잘 보내다 갔습니다 : )
positive	We absolutely loved the hotel, the room was perfect had 3 amazing nights sleeps. The staff were friendly. Our only grumble would be the pool definitely needs updating it's not in the best condition we loved the hotel and would definitely go back.
positive	Très bonne expérience ! Je recommande cet hôtel à tous ceux qui veulent visiter Londres. Il se situe à quelques stations de métro du centre-ville (entre 15 et 20 minutes de trajet) et propose un bon rapport qualité/prix. Seul bémol : il n'y a pas d'ascenseur (mais on s'en passe aisément).
positive	Very elegant hotel. Much nicer than expected. Great staff and breakfast, beautiful lobby.
positive	Every aspect of our stay was superlative. This would include access, parking, prompt check-in, friendly staff, ultra clean room, and excellent breakfast. The real bonus was the 5:30 to 7:00 free buffet. This was my first visit to a Drury Hotel but certainly not my last. As I was travelling, this was my fourth hotel in a short period of time, but was by far my best experience.
positive	great hotel . clean, great food. great swimming pool
positive	Excellent Hotel, wonderful food, beautiful views, close to the Port and shopping.
positive	Friendly service. Nice and neat rooms. Great location.
positive	Beautiful hotel, with the most welcoming of staff. The mattresses and pillows could do with a change if being picky, not the best night sleep with the pillows being too hard, but then again that's just down to personal preference. Great hotel, would recommend!👍👍
positive	The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our 2 bedroom condo was very spacious for our family of 8. The kids loved the pool and water spray area. We didn't want to leave.
positive	Nice hotel with good amenities. Very professional and efficient personnel. Great breakfast. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
positive	Una settimana tra lavoro e vacanza accompagnato da mia moglie. Ottime facilities et ristoranti tranquilli con servizio e cibi eccellenti utilizzati anche per cene di lavoro con piena soddisfazione dei miei ospiti.
positive	Foram 5 dias de excelente estadias. Horel super confortável, em frente a praia
positive	The staff were very nice. The breakfast was delicious especially since it's complementary! The room had a balcony and the added small kitchen suite was great. I would highly recommend going here.
positive	Wir haben über Weihnachten und Neujahr 2107, 10 Tage in diese Hotel gewohnt. Das Zimmer was sehr, sehr sauber und ruhig. (Wir hatten ein Zimmer im 7en Stock nach hinten heraus). Das Personal war immer sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Hotel liegt nicht weit vom Union Square sodaß alles zu Fuss gut erreichbar ist. Würde immer wider dort hin gehen. For den bezahlten Preis was das Hotel TOP!
positive	Everything about the hotel was amazing no exaggerations
positive	Nice hotel close to the restaurant and shopping. Comfortable bed.
positive	very friendly, restaurant attached and reasonable...convenient, next-door to large banyan tree...art exhibit under tree on Sunday as we left...close to visitor center
positive	I booked this hotel in first place because of its nearby location to another venue we were spending the evening for her birthday, and just saw the Marriott as aplace to lay our heads, however because of the quality of staff, particulaly the receptionist who booked us in ,it became so much more. We were treating with politness and good humour and when the staff found out it was my wifes birthday the staff kicked into complete overdrive doing all in their power to make our stay a memorable one, and they achieved that with flying colours. The choice of room , the free champagne , the use of the executive club was far more then we could of expected and was very gratefully appreciated, thank you to all at the Marriott , Grovernor Square, you are a credit to yourselves.
positive	Modern, comfortable, spacious premium room. Exceeded my expectations.
positive	Close to everything in San Diego, very easy to travel to Midway and Torrey Pines
positive	Short walk to gray bay beach, people are super friendly and we were only a short walk distance to restaurants and shops
positive	Very quaint property. Nicely decorated rooms. Hotel was very quiet. Wine tasting in the evening was a nice touch.
positive	Lovely inn very conveniently located close to the center on Sonoma. Would absolutely stay there again!
positive	Friendly staff who are always eager to help. Top speed house-keeping. Interior furnishing is a little dated and old but made up for by the excellent view the resort could offer. Fast wifi speed. Breakfast was ala carte and strictly no second portions (although there is a buffet option only when guest numbers exceed 30) which is a letdown since I'm heavy on breakfasts.
positive	Everything was easy from check-in to check-out. Was a little slow getting the car when leaving but the valet was busy because it was 11 AM when everyone was checking out.. so that was really our fault. Great experiencd, have stayed here twice before and would stay again!
positive	アーリーチェックインができて大変助かりました。対応も丁寧で親切でした。お部屋も1ベッドから2ベッドへ変更して頂けました。とてもかわいい部屋でしたし、アメニティもアオレンジや赤を使ってあり、女子にとっては居心地のよい部屋でした。また泊まりたいと思います。
positive	The staff was the best I've ever had.. pool was great.. dinner was always amazing
positive	Staff was top notch! Soco restaurant was nice. Although I did not care for the limited menu for diner or evening snack. I think they could do better.
positive	Staff was amazing and helpful guided you to places to enjoy your time! Definatly coming back to this hotel.
positive	二回目の滞在です。 ウブドの街から近いのに、とても静かで素敵なホテルです。 インフィニティプールがとても気に入っています。
positive	From check in to check out this experience was great! The rooms are spacious, comfortable and with great views of the city.
positive	Remoled, clean, comfortable & security guard @ entrance around the clock. 2-3 blocks from our favorite restaurants, Arnauds & Bourbon House (oysters & redfish are the best), About 7 blocks from Jackson Square, Pat Obriens, & shopping on Chartres.
positive	Probably one of the best hostels I've stayed at. The staff made me feel very at home and there was a good vibe in the hostel making it easy to make friends and meet new people. The hostel runs really cool events at night that you really can't miss. Karen was one of the staffers that checked me in and she was really sociable and helpful. The hostel is also situated in the center of everything so it was really easy to get around.
positive	The staff was very helpful and the service was great. Hotel location is very good and will always stay in the future in this hotel
positive	Our experience was great until a medical emergency changed that; but prior to that and during it was great. What I liked about this Resort was the fact that they had Managers/Representative on site with the businesses they work with (for e.g., the Restaurants, the parking co., some of the retail cubicles, etc.) We had a complaint about one of the restaurants and they called the manager/rep and boom the issue was resolved. We had an issue with the parking cost and they called manager/rep and boom we came to a compromise. Very, very helpful and polite staff.
positive	Good service, very easy access to universal parks and city walk. Great deal with the express pass and one hour early access to parks.
negative	We were not told a specific van for the shuttle, just the spot and there are two Days Inn which we went to the wrong one. The room was yucky, bathroom had bugs and the shower leaked water on the floor, and the breakfast was cleaned up at 9 am sharp (we were trying to get food and the just removed right in front of us). The shuttle driver was very nice.
negative	There are many more options in this area that offer better service at a lower cost.
negative	I got eaten alive inside our room. I'm currently taking all precautions to make sure that I didn't bring any home. The rooms are so outdated and the beds are extremely uncomfortable. The toilet looks like its from a public bathroom. The facilities are dilapidated and the free breakfast is disgusting.
negative	I have ty say this is the first time I felt a need to write a review. If you're reading this please be advised... the three stars are for a reason! The building is horribly old which means bad plumbing, cockroach infestation, and who know what other bugs live there! It's an affordable place for a reason! Staff there were and are exceptional! I can't say anything bad about them. Viviana, Maria, and another manager there I can't remember her name were so wonderful in trying to make a more confotable stay for us during such a really disgusting and disappointing experience. Ramada/Wyndham have got to fix this problem....tear it down and start over with that property--I know it means less affordability, but that can be dealt with. Fecal juice coming up in the tub you wash your child...nope can't do it! I won't post pics too gross not nice at all!
negative	We called the hotel from the airport to arrange our shuttle. The number was no longer in service!!! We called their sister Ramada hotel and they said they have received a lot of calls saying the same thing! They only had the number that we had. After trying to two hours we booked another hotel which was amazing! The Crowne hotel is amazing! Expedia also tried numerous times to get ahold of the hotel for us. They found an alternate number which the hotel answered once but never again after that. Still waiting for the manager of Ramada to be there.... it's amazing he's always out when Expedia calls for a refund. What a joke! Totally ruined our first day.
negative	We didn't stay. It was dangerous and disgusting. I was with my son and we just left. The worst place ever. It was also a hostel which was never told to us. Very upset and will be calling for my money back since we were too scared to stay and had to find another hotel. Worst experience with expedia.
negative	The room was so dirty I understand I only paid $50 but come on people room was so dirty bed was hard and it just wasn't worth it free breakfast was a joke. I only was there for 1 night thank goodness. Never again. Staff was ok , I wanted to check in at 1:30pm and they said I had to wait until 2:45pm. So I had to leave and come back.
negative	Hotel emailed me less than 24 hr before my arrival to inform me my room is unavailable and downgraded my 3bedroom family room to 3 small deluxe rooms. Difference of S$100 . NO REFUND given. Cannot check in at 6pm. Rooms Not Ready. Hotel website indicated check in time at 2pm. Waited almost 1 hr before I can check in. Blood stained bedsheets, dirty towels and balcony full of cigarette butts.
negative	The hotel itself is old and in need of renovation, the staff were not welcoming and impolite on 2 occasions and I would not recommend the hotel to others
negative	Let down with hotel conditions. Expecting more with 4.3 star rating
negative	Got checked into a room that hadn't been cleaned. Second room had no stove plates( no way to cook our food). Third room was okay but we woke up with bed bug bites.
negative	the hotel outside is nice but the room is so dated , dirty and smell.
negative	很髒又舊的飯店.一個早餐要自費300泰元,第一間我們的房間,整個都沒打掃,我們才又去櫃台換房間,走廊地毯又舊又沒鋪平,像海浪依樣,根本沒能好好拖行自己的行李.
negative	This is the worst Country Inn and Suites we have ever stayed at. The condition of this hotel is more like one of the low end chains just before they tear them down. The room we stayed in was terrible. The carpet was worn, the beds were…well the floor would have been more comfortable. The bathroom….most of the floor tiles were loose the vanity was falling off the wall. I could go on and on but I think you get the point…..Don’t Stay Here.
negative	Location is great, close to everything Bondi has to offer. Despite the hostels best efforts to keep the facilities clean there are a few too many cockroaches for my liking. Though there are cockroaches everywhere in Bondi, we stayed during a heat wave which made them more present. Didn't help that our window only opened two inches making the room hotter than outside. If you plan to be exploring outside for a majority of your stay this place is cheap enough to let you enjoy the area without breaking the bank. Just make sure you have a few drinks on the rooftop at night to cool down and catch a buzz before crawling into bed with the mystery critters.
negative	The water in shower lukewarm, but sink water hot???? The Floor had particles of hair. And small bits trash. I was charged 89.00 but all local guest charged 70 TV didn't work well all I could see was shawdows ( and room that I was supposed to swap with was worst. The area was scary This was not hotel, it was a nasty motel
negative	Hotel means well but does not deliver. Bad that locals in London asked "You're not staying at the Britannia in Canary Wharf, are you?" Food was horrible with no flavor. Same every visit and not worth the cost.
negative	The room has lot of dust and heating was too old so it wasn't work...
negative	Im gesamten Hotel roch es extrem nach Reinigungsmittel bzw. Desinfektionsmittel, so dass meine Schwester eine allergische Reaktionen bekommen hat und Sie kaum Luft bekam... Wir mussten uns ein anderes Hotel nehmen... Leider hat expedia nicht auf meine Reklamation reagiert. Das Geld bekommen wir nicht zurück den das Hotel fühlt sich nicht verantwortlich uns die Kosten zu erstatten... Obwohl Sie ja die Verursacher sind...
negative	this hotel was a nightmare, it is being renovated so when you enter there it looks like you are staying in a hotel that is being constructed, staff is very unprofessional and not courteous and they have the nerve to charge for parking when their facility is a mess, i blame expedia for doing business on behalf of this hotel i will never use this hotel or expedia again for my travel needs
negative	Terrible, so dirty that we slept with our clothes, not recomend to anybody must avoid to all cost, only if you are in a desperate situation and you need keep away from cold, or you are a fugitive and you run away from your captures. I don't know why this hotel is on the list How much I need to say about this
negative	Rooms need to lot up date!!!no fridge:(((horrible smelly carpets!!!soooo hard beds and nasty dirty bathroom!!!!
negative	Had to change room twice due to them trying to downgrade the room I paid for. The place is dirty and has a brown theme throughout, it reminds me of the 70s, presumably that was when it was last updated. The check in and breakfast is mayhem. If your staying 1 night travelling through BKK then fair enough but don't make this your main hotel, you will be disappointed.
negative	Absolutely one of the worse hotels ive been in never again
negative	A great example of how not to run a hotel. The $15 a night tax is a ripoff too. Do not stay here
negative	The room was filthy- there was dried food on the bedside lockers that my wife was able to scrape off- when we complained a manager came up and told us that she wasn't going to listen to abuse- we explained that we were not happy she didn't offer another room so we asked for a refund which we eventually got and left the hotel
negative	Horrible bed. Lump down the middle $24.50 for 2 orders of toast Couldn't turn on heat as bed was against baseboard. Room is very small
negative	The building I was in had not been renovated. Sink fixture was rusty. Wallpaper.wasdirty and peeling off. Balcony had not been cleaned. Hallway leading to my room was also dirty. My room was overpriced. It was not worth it. I feel I should be getting money backfrom this deal. Mary Jane Santoro
negative	Small room, dirty, the walls were dirty in other word terrible experience
negative	Empfang exzellent und freundlich. Wechselte das Zimmer dann 3x. 1. extrem laut (Aufzug), 2. extremer Geruch nach Altersheim, 3. sehr laut (Hauptverkehrsstraße, keine Schallschutzfenster), 4. innenliegend, kein Tageslicht, sehr klein, muffig aber noch das Beste von allen. Fazit nach 4 Tagen: nie wieder
negative	Our door lock was broken. Had to be moved from a room with two beds to a room with one bed and a pull out couch that was horribly uncomfortable. The hot tub was not working well... lukewarm... and my kids were able to remove hands full of sand from it. Absolutely gross. When staff were approached about these frustrations, I had to wait while the manager finished his cellphone texting. He made no apologies for anything. Never returning!
negative	The photos online were NOT the same as the actual hotel! Horrible area, very dangerous, outside entrance to OLD, WORN DOWN AND OUT ROOMS!!! Horrible!!!!
negative	We stayed for two nights. We arrived late, around 1am, and that was our first night, the a/c/heat system did't work, it was cold in the room, and there was only one super thin quilt. The following morning we called and they sent a technician up, he said the motor of the unit wasn't working, he needed to find the part to fix it. He did fix it, and we thought everything would be fine for the following night. The second night, at around 3:20am, we were waken by some loud noises from upstair, the noise was continued for about 15 minutes, finally we called the front desk at 3:33am to complain. After a while the noises were still there but not as loud as before. At 9am, the full blasted drilling started upstairs, that explained what the noises were at 3:30am. But we, as customers, never were given any notice or warning about the construction.
negative	I found the staff to be more interested in talking to each other. I called up ahead of time as I ordered a room with 2 beds but it stated 1. I called to make the change. I got there and said I needed a room with 2 beds we when to the room it had 1 bed and the phone was not working to call down stairs. I went back to reception, where they gave me another room with TWO BEDS BUT THE BEDS COULD NOT BE SPLIT. Please note the rooms are clean but very small and they are doing some reconstructing to the rooms so expect some banging.
negative	In more than 40 years of traveling, the Woodsprings Suites in Sanford has to be the WORST hotel experience of my entire career. Had to wait for hotel clerk to open the sliding metal security encasement in order to check in. Rude clerk. Terribly dirty hall ways and room filled with cigarette smoke odor. Dirty bathroom. All resulting in a 0 star on the 5 star scale.
negative	come nel titolo le lenzuola erano luride, il personale scortese, il cambio asciugamani solo il primo giorno, le scale a chiocciola molto strette e scomodissime con il bagaglio, bagno comune all'esterno. L'unica cosa positiva è situato a centro città.
negative	The closet smelled like mildew the shower water would not go down n the toilet over spilled with water you can smell it wasnt the first time it happen!! The staff were really nice and very pleasant i would stay if the hotel got a major upgrade on it!
negative	I found a lighter in my bed,it was under one of the pillows. Plugs in the "bathroom" (the sink is the room inside the door) don't work and look burnt out, gym literally only has one dumbbell. It was close to the airport, but for what it's worth, go over to San Bruno and get a car (cheaper than the airport and not far) and then travel a further to a nicer hotel. This one was rough.
negative	Upon entering my room, I found the bed stripped, unmade with no fresh linens. When I went to call the front desk, the phone by the bed did not work. The bathroom had no toilet paper roll and no bath mat and only one set of towels for a suite that was to sleep 2 people. There was a Sheriff's Dept car cruising the parking lot with a flood light on, looking for a suspect. I did not feel safe there. The front desk staff were nice and apologetic, but the place is a disaster.
negative	J'ai fait une réservation à partir de Montreal avec expedia en sept.2016 pour un voyage en janv.2017. Nous sommes arrivé le 14 janv.17 en soirée, la veille de l'arrivée d'un avion Français et nous avons payé le prix ! 1-Premièrement, on nous donné un studio au r-d-c avec un bois derrière et beaucoup de moustiques, pas de mousticaire. Nous avons demander de changer, mais impossible, car toutes les chambres étaient réservé pour les français qui arrivaient le lendemain. La cuisine était à l' exterieur, donc tres difficile de cuisiner. 2- air conditionné fonctionnait par intermitemps, donc il faisait très chaud et la chambre était très humide avec une odeur. 3- 3e journée, pas d'eau quand nous sommes réveillés. 4- pas d'eau chaude si nous prenions notre douche apres 18h.
negative	I had one of the rooms next to the door into the hostel at that was a nightmare. There was so much noice for everytime someone went ind at the door slammed. And there were people all night coming in and out. I tried to block the door from closing so it would not slammed but their security guard got very upset about that. I got very little sleep because of that so had to sleep during the day where the door was constantly open. However it was also next to the reception bring noice there. I stayed at more than 40 hostels now and this has been the worst experience.
negative	+ Location - No 24hr Desk - Limited Parking - Free Breakfast is limited to coffee and snacks - Lots of seemingly long term residents who are very loud and obnoxious - Wifi is spotty at best even for hotel Wifi standards
negative	There were literally 50 people with all their luggage in the lobby of a casino to get to the desk and get a key to a room at midnight. The staff was kind and helpful. My reservation was inaccurate and I was billed for 4 nights instead of one which included a $28.11 charge for a hotel tax daily. It was an expensive 6 hour sleep for me as I rented a car to see Zion National Park and only wanted to sleep and leave in the morning. Anywhere else I would have had an extra hour to enjoy the room.
negative	Room was dirty with ghost ants on the bathroom sink counter where the coffee pot is and climbing up the bathroom wall when we got there. They called pest control who was suppose to take care of them. Then when we got back to our room, the ants were gone except for a few stragglers. Until we saw a cockroach on the microwave and killed it. The bedspread had a white stain on it and when we called concierge on the phone...some man said, "the room is fine lady!" And hung up on me. I told the front desk lady and she said she didn't know who answers the concierge button called on the phone. How is this?!?! Then they never changed the bedspread as she stated she would. This place was horrible.
negative	Misleading photos ...Hotel under renovation .. towels are hard as a rug ..
negative	The hotel needs major up keep it is in a great location but it's dated now. The beds are really uncomfortable and the included breakfast isn't much. The staff is OK but overall I'd stay away from this place. No point in getting a hotel you can't sleep in. Also my reservation had a free welcome drink noted, it's just something else I didn't get.
negative	The staff was rude, didn't give us more than one key, we didn't get our room cleaned, the pool closed too early, the bed was super uncomfortable and the blanket was thin, and finally the shower was very complicated and hard to work.
negative	This is the most lousy hotel i ever stay in Bangkok.The room was not the same as in picture. The bathroom door lock has broken and i was locked inside, the handle came off when i closed the door. I was so shocked but luckily my sister came in and open from the outside. The water heater you can only choose too hot or too cold !! The funniest thing was , the shower head felt on my head when i'm shower .. Omg what kind of hotel is this?? Everything broken and everything was so out is just like the 1970's or 1980s design! I will never ever come back !
negative	Be careful booking. They throw a $120 cleaning fee on top of rate. Not really a hotel, more of apartment comlex.
negative	Rudest hotel staff of all times. The place has terrible food and the rooms smell like mildew. How this is rated a luxury hotel is a joke. It is not renovated the carpet is dirty and in no way can it be considered a luxury property. The rooms were poor not even average. But the deal breaker is the staff. This hotel should be shut down. Everyone is rude and they overcharged me by a week yet never apologized. I have stayed in every part of Manhattan luxury hotels to 3 stars. This experience was abdolutkey the worst. The fm should be fired for discrimination. Never stay at this hotel it was a total let down and an awful experience.
negative	Expedia charged me over $200/night for a room in a basement, with no window. You have lost my trust Expedia shame on you.
negative	As a travel nurse used to staying in hotels all over the country, this is my worst experience in customer service. The accommodations were ok but the staff, especially the manager was horrible. Will never repeat a visit to this location. Had better experience at the best western 4miles away, even though it was not a best western "plus".
negative	I WAS TOO MANY KIDS THERE NOT ENOUGH ACTION BS SLOT MACHINES
negative	荷物は部屋に運んでくれない。最後タクシーまでにも完全セルフです。人生初めて住んだホテル。ベランダの窓は完全閉められない。隙間は大きい。深夜まで超うるさい。5星のホテルと書いたが、本当に信じられない。
negative	I will never stay at a Cotton Woods suites ever again. I was charged a bogus $209.00 fee for what they said was a smoking fee. They accused that someone had smoked in the room...which NOONE had!!! I called for several days asking to speak to a manager to discuss what apparent evidence they had (this is the word they used "evidence") but both the General Manager Michelle and assistant Manager Annette refused to speak to me. They would not even talk to me!! I was left to just speak to the front desk person. He told me they refused to speak to me and the only advice they would give was to dispute it with bank. HORRIBLE customer service and i will NEVER stay at one of these hotels ever again!!!! So make sure you review your bank statement after you stay there because you may also fall victim to their erroneous bogus fees!!!
negative	The desk clerk was HORRIBLE. She was rude and when I told her I would be be contacting management she said, "Go ahead,that's fine; I don't care"
negative	The room was dirty. Shower disgusting. Ants in the room. The floor was dirty. We did not feel comfortable at all. Should've opted to spend more to be comfortable.
negative	Holes in the bathroom wall, burn marks on the tables in a non-smoking room, cobwebs and dirt. Super shady people in the lobby. Bad experience.
negative	Light Sleeper? stay away from that hoter. I was waking up every 15-20 minutes, every time the heater was kicking off. Can't believe they would install such primitive heaters
negative	Rooms are not clean, smells of cigarette smoke on arrival. Elevator broke down, after I warned them about a noise in the motor on decent, on first arrival. Somehow greasy food and big breasted wait staff is not enough. You should ask to see your room before you pay. They also lock up your daily deposit fee for up to 30 days, which they don't disclose on arrival.
negative	The hotel offers weekly rates for persons displaced from homes (homeless population). The clientele appeared to be thugs or drug users. There was a lot of foot traffic surrounding the hotel and a lot of junky cars. A cop car was circling the parking lot. My smoke free room tracked of cigarette smoke and there was grafetti on the mirror stating "get it up". I walked into the room, set my room key down on the bed, and walked out. I checked into another hotel for the night.
negative	Staff was really rude upon calling to see if early check in would be available. No need to go into details- but not the way you want to start a vacay. Room was comfy.. but turd streak in the toilet made me feel it wasn't cleaned properly.
negative	服務超差！沒全力幫助客人，晚上不幫已弄髒床單，叫我們自己換，問是選那一個wifi login說她不懂中文！
negative	Place was filthy. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. Staff was ok, hit or miss depending on the person. Bathtub was disgusting, had to shower with antibacterial after showering. Shower had tiny maggots at one point. I wouldn't let my worst enemy stay here. I've never experienced such a thing in my life. I thought I was in a third world country.
negative	luckily I went with my softball team, my wife would never have even gone in the room
negative	tapisserie déchiré, bruit toute la nuit, porte savon avec brulure de cigarette
negative	Hotel staff was very rude. Said hotel was old and if we didn't like it we could go somewhere else. We froze at night due to heater being broken. Never going back!
negative	Great staff very helpful, unfortunately too close to the airport. We lay awake listening to aircraft landing and taking off, also was told the next morning that the compressors we could hear all night long were tour buses parked close by. Zero sleep, may as well stayed home and travelled in the 100 miles from home to make the early flight. Know better next time.
negative	The pics of this hotel looked nice and helped convince me to choose it. However, they must have been taken years ago because, although they resembled the pics, the hotel is very run down, rooms are old, there is no entrance security, security on windows, or lock boxes in the room. Also, there is only on-street metered parking. Every 2 hours you need to put more money in the meter. We spent 15 minutes in the room before we checked out and cancelled our reservation. We felt it would be dangerous to leave our belongings in the room unattended for fear of theft. Also, the housekeeper on duty did not speak even a little English. The walls are thin and we could hear other guests conversations and babies crying. This hotel reminded us of hotels in movies were criminals go to hideout or are used for prostitution. I would not recommend it and suggest that Expedia removes them from their portfolio until a complete overhaul is done.
negative	We were disgusted by our room. My son the next day had two bites of some sort on his knees. My wife and I were itching the whole night. The picture was nothing like reality. I hope you read this and don't book here because you will regret it unfortunately. this hotel should be rated 1 star nowhere near a 2.5. I've stayed at better MOTELS than this garbage. Don't waste your money and regret it after.
negative	This hotel is old and very very tired. There is very little evidence of general maintenance. The rooms smelled. The mattresses were thick with mattress pads to hide sagging beds. The showers were rusty and stained. The upholstery and furniture were no better than road side garbage. The television was of 1970 quality and room service was nothing less than overpriced. $25 to deliver 2 drinks.
negative	Terrible place to stay. Best that can be said is that it is close to the cruise pier. Even if the pier shuttle did have to make 4 trips on a Saturday. And the bed was not too uncomfortable. TV remote did not work. Bedside lamp cord did not reach outlet. No hot water. Bath door would not shut. Room door would not shut tight unless locked. No blanket on bed, but OK, I guess, given it's Miami. Old, out-dated, so bath very cramped. "Continental breakfast" was toast, coffee cake and coffee only. Nice little curved settee. Would absolutely NOT stay here again.
negative	When I booked the room the room picture looked modern and updated. When I got my first room it looked like it was updated in 1970. They changed my room to a more modern room but still out dated. I never had more than two towels and 1 face cloth I guess that was OK but it was the same face cloth they left in the shower all week. I am sure many of these rooms have ended up in crime scean photos. The staff was nice and tried to help however they had nothing to work with.
negative	I DO NOT recommend to book online this hotel. Once arrived I was asked to move to another hotel ; room was dirty, stinky and did not match at all my booking. I finally came back in Unic Renoir : the room was also dirty, the bed had not been cleaned before I came (found hair and bad smell inside) and totally different from website pictures. RUN AWAY
negative	We arrive at this hotel after a family wedding , my mom goes to sit on her bed & sits on something hard,she pulls back the covers to find a box of KY jelly !! The maid just made the bed and didn't change the sheets obviously!YUCK ..so we gather our belongings & precede to the lobby to get a new room.Pool was freezing, this was not Marriots usual standard I will never go here again & probably never to a Marriot either.
negative	We had high hopes for this hotel. The room was beautifully decorated and staff were attentive. Unfortunately as soon as the restaurant opens the noise is unbearable! The problem is on the second floor there is a window partition separating the restaurant from the rooms on that floor. We had to leave the hotel at 5 am for the airport and the noise from the restaurant did not stop until 11pm. I tried to call the front desk several times but the phone did not work. I finally found the number to call on a piece of paper in the drawer but the phone did not work. Not sure why the owners of this hotel would miss this very important detail. The noise was so bad even earplugs would not help. Very disappointed!!!! Denise C. Date of stay 1/26/17
negative	Was charged for a deluxe room but given a standard, no room to move in the bathroom, dirty and not ready when I arrived. Overall the room was dirty and worn. Recommended for teeny tiny people only, would hate to see the contortionist act two people with luggage would have to go through to stay in here.
negative	Butikken ligger ved siden av en coffeeshop så det lukter rimelig "stramt" inne på hotellet. Betjeningen var sur og svært lite hjelpsomme. Veldig sjeldent jeg har opplevd uhøflige mennesker i resepsjonen. Varmeapparatet var skrudd av noe som førte til at jeg ble nødt til å sove med klær på. Anbefales på ingen måte.
negative	The room are very humid very dirty they don't clean the room every day it's a horrible smell I don't recommend it
negative	I had bad experience with this hotel. There was no housekeeping for all the days of my stay. On day 1, housekeeping was not there because of Christmas which I could understand and I adjusted to it. The hotel staff was trying to give me half the required no. of towels than i requested for. The staff finally gave me the required no. I was hoping that the next day housekeeping would resume and I could have a clean room and new set of towels. Unfortunately there was no housekeeping on the next day too. This is was the first time in life where I have been to a hotel that had no housekeeping. Extremely disappointed. I never had such experience with Marriott branded hotels.
negative	I paid for a junior suite with a step down living room. I got a Bix 6 Motel room. Being large doesn't make it a suite. The furniture looked like it came from Goodwill. It was, by far, the worst hotel room I have EVER stayed in!!! We tried and tried to change the room but were told you were full. How can that be, we made our reservations way in advance and reconfirmed everything just days before we arrived. We met your guests Shiqana and husband Andy. They had the same problem on check in, after we had arrived and were upgraded to Villa #4!!! Why not us. Youir hotel is garbage.
negative	The customer service was horrible I will never stay at another one of there hotels.
negative	The fire alarm in the hotel went off TWICE. TWICE! Once at midnight, and once at 1:35am. Worst night in a hotel ever.
negative	poor management , I complaint about my stay and the manager at the hotel did not want to find out my issue and ignore to contact me to find out my problems
negative	Very dirty. No ice in machines. Crapy WiFi. Crapy cable and tv. Full of ants crawling around. No plug for bathtub. Drunk person roaming halls harassing guests. Guests smoking in rooms halls smell of marajiwana. Worst expiereanced ever..
negative	Room is too small. Toilet jamed although it was fixed later. Front desk need to polish their customer service skill. I asked to break a $100 bill but was given all $1 bill. Front desk staff not helpful with internet connection given I paid for it. There are some other hotels nearby. Please avoid this hotel. In one of the night a strands came into the room. Luckily we were at the room.
negative	I booked this room for my son and his girlfriend for Christmas break From the fruit fly infested breakfast area to the theft of clothes and absolutely horrible treatment of housekeeping staff Including them calling my kids they are white trash because they didn't like their stufff rifled through and stolen And accused that The reason they were staying there because this was the only place they could stay Don't ever go here Ever
negative	I am a regular traveler and this week I left home not feeling too well and got more sick as Monday went on. I went to DR and decided to go back home on Tuesday morning. My original reservation was for 3 nights (through Thursday). I notified Expedia and the hotel front desk on MONDAY evening of my plan. The hotel charged for ALL 3 NIGHTS. They would not even consider taking off 1 of the nights. I told them Monday giving plenty of notice. They still charged me through Thursday. I will never use Sheraton again. It is a shame the hotel is very close to a client that I will be working with for the next year. Use MARROITT they are great about this kind of stuff.
negative	Dirty, bad staff, not a four star in any way the value payed is very much compared to the hotel level, not chance to reconsider it in my travel
negative	We called downstairs to advise of the situation. They then promised to have someone come up and check. No one showed up. Called. No one showed up. Luckily it was cold outside and we opened up the balcony. But, I don't pay for a hotel to sleep with the balcony door open. Not staying there again.
negative	It felt unsafe. There were bugs running around on the floor. There was no cell phone reception Wi-Fi did not work vending machines did not work ice machines did not work some of the tiles in the ceiling in the bathroom were exposed the air conditioner did not work properly and stuff is very unfriendly
negative	Check in was ridiculous, over a hour in a cue. Lots of guest cueing to complain. I imagine lad behind reception and duty manager we're fed up with dealing with the endless complaints, but as it was there job maybe need to learn to smile, room was not made up when we went in, used towels, dirty bed linen, left previous guests items of clothing. It was put right after complaining, overcharged by £200 , again put right after standing in a cue at reception!!
negative	Had to leave after checking in bugs in the room and no cart to carry our bags
negative	Was totally disgusted. This place is the worst place I have ever stayed....totally falling apart, and has not been touched since 1970. Would have done better staying in a hostel. Ruined our trip.
negative	Was charged twice one night had to show my itinerary to the manager to ensure that the rate was honored; union getting home turns out I still was charged a higher rate and now both TRYP and Expedia are playing the blame game. Also, the $65/night parking made the cost of this hotel equal to the amount we would have paid for the most expensive choice we had available. Left with a bitter taste in our mouth after such an amazing experience otherwise is sad. New York again, absolutely but unless this is resolved TRYP and Expedia will no longer have myself, my sister, or my family as customers.
negative	extra charge 27USD per day for failing services no hot water from time to time old and smelly carpet old and very noisy heater bath towels not changed avoid this hotel, will never go back there
negative	We recently stayed here for a few days and to say the least i will not be returning. The staff make you feel like you are bothering them anytime you ask a question. This place is not a bed and breakfast its a hotel with a continental breakfast. The room was nice but the servicr from the staff was worse than any hotel ive ever stayed at and we travel once a month atleast. My advice to anyone reading this is spend your money at a different hotel or bes and breakfast.
negative	Great comfort friendly meals drinks bedroom all good. Shopping centre nearby. Done
negative	Absolutely terrible and nothing compared to the photos. Our room smelled like weed in the middle of the night with our children in it. There were hair balls on our clean towels. The floors and shower were so dirty we had to wear shoes.
negative	It's horrible, as soon you walk in it makes you feel like America horror Hotel, it smells so bad and it's just awful, the rooms look like a prision just a bed a little sick! Please stay away from it . Run run run! Me and my husband only were there for 10 min and we cancelled it right away, the manager offered us to stay one night ! But we just couldn't and charged us for one night only even tho we did a reservation for 3 days . Please don't waste your time or money .
negative	Muita fila no checkin e ambiente muito ruim, pessoas absolutamente sem classe e educação
negative	I walked into the hotel to check in, and one of the lady's behind the desk continued to go on and on about how she got sent to jail for manslaughter. All meanwhile I'm being checked into my room and the manager proceeds to tell me that they no longer have the room I booked (They overbook their rooms with railroad workers) so they had to give me a different one. Long story short I didn't even stay the night here because I didn't feel safe. 10/10 don't stay here
negative	Room was ice cold upon arrival with my way wife and 3 young children. Turned the heat all the way up on 90 and still was only warm in the room. Tried to shower and the water was lukewarm. The water in the sink was hotter. Just an awful experience.
negative	This hotel was not comfortable at all. The bed was lumpy, and even after we had the feather topper switched out for a 2nd, it was still very hard to sleep. On top of this, the light switches are illuminated, and they stay that way all night. One is right next to the bed, so it shines in your face. The phone also has a 6 inch touch screen that dims, but does not go totally dark. We like a dark room to sleep in, and this hotel definitely does not provide that. Also, the A/C is on a motion sensor to conserve power. This is fine during the day, but is really frustrating at night, since you wake up in the middle of the night to stale air. All the staff was great, and the hotel is well kept, but if you like to sleep in a dark, cool room like we do, then this is not the hotel for you.
negative	Arrived and checked into room. No electricity. Various attempts to deal with possible circuit breaker issue. I was offered a different room. Asked why previous guests had departed (town was filled to capacity for hotel occupancy). I was told they were annoyed by the ants Naive young student running desk. All management off site and apparently not easy to reach. Steer clear of this place.
negative	What a dump! The room was very old and ran down. The bathroom door had greasy finger marks on the outside of the door when we first entered the room. We should have turned around and ran right away. We will not use this hotel again.
negative	I would rate this place great if i had actually stayed there. I stayed at the D las vegas not the M.
negative	This hotel is NOT in San Juan, it is misleading to put San Juan/Bayamon. It should be Bayamón, period.
negative	We arrived at 4am . It was myself and 2 friends. When my friend went to the bathroom, the door broke and she couldn't get out so we had to hold up and push the door. It took us some time do to the fact that we are oldies ladies. We were so tired of the trip that we went to bed and next day i went to the counter and told them and their actitute was so "i don't care "i ask them for some time until 12 , lunch time and it was not able to do it.
negative	Stayed for 10 nights. Was rated as 4 star but it was not. For the cost, I expected a more modern newer hotel. Cleaning staff were polite and cordial, but not the security (for which I only saw 2 at the entrance on my last day) and bell hops did not greet visitors by even saying hello. Wifi was good.
negative	Ppl where not nice if I could have gotten my money bk I would have never again will I come to this hotel rooms didn't look lk pic also think the have bed bugs something was biting me
negative	This hotel has Bedbugs !!! The manager tried to act oblivious to them when I brought them to their attention . She literally acted like she didn't know what they were ! When I mentioned they were definitely bedbugs - she tried denying it . The bugs were not small they were huge . Bit my daughter in less than 5 min once in the bed . When we pulled the blankets back they were coming from under the mattress by the loads & of all different sizes . You could see the eggs on crevices of the box springs close to the headboard area . I will never stay here again !!
negative	We had to change rooms as the first one was frigid and the overwhelming stench of wet towels was in the carpeting in the room and hall. Second room did not improve much as the toxic smell was to a lesser degree. Impossible to get a good nights sleep and very overpriced. I woke up with a dozen bug bites all over my torso and arms
negative	Requested a 3rd pillow due to pregnancy and they refused to honor this simple request. Leaky bathroom damaged personal items and again no response
negative	The staff was awful. Our room was very dirty. Our key cards never would work.
negative	We stayed one night, could not sleep, very noisy, this hotel caters for a bunch of huliguns every year, turned out it was the time we were there. It was if they had some type of a ritual, running back and forth in the hallways, and slamming doors and screaming loud all night until approx. 5am. We were scared. The next day we told the hotel clerk of our horrible night, he told us that that's a annual event with these people. I will never stay at this hotel again...the hotel clerks should have used their discretion and not put other paying customers in that area unless they were fully booked.there were empty rooms.
negative	Took my kids there so we can go swimming charge me for Resort fees when the pool was closed
negative	이용전 두차례에 걸친 카드 결제, 익스피디아에서 제시한 금액보다 훨씬 많은 금액이 설명도 없이 청구되어 여행을 다녀온 후에도 정말 찜찜하다.
negative	There is club near hotel entrance. Club also sharing same entrance. Noisy during night till 3:30AM every nights due to club. This is a non smoking hotel, but lots of smoking smell is at hotel entrance. I found bathroom sink was clogged in first night. There is only one bath towel in bathroom. I called font desk ask for second towel, then they supply second towel. I called & asked about small towel to wipe hands next day. they supply small towel. There is no towel for step out from bath tub. Hotel room carpet is dirty & smelly. Entire hotel walkway have old & smelly carpet. There is no toaster or oven or microwave oven in breakfast place. Orange Juice is from tin. We did not like arrangement for breakfast. I paid for it, so we used for tea.
negative	The hotel is beautiful, food is great, The amenities are in pristine condition and very clean, the staff in general is OK. Front desk takes forever to answer, and the manager who I had a problem at the hotel was horrible towards me and very mean
negative	Hosteeva will never get my money. I will tell everyone never to book them. I highly recommend not staying there
negative	Yes its close to Disney Springs but that is where any good points about the hotel end. I stayed at this hotel as it is where my 5 day conference was being held. A terrible old, smelly "motel" NOT hotel. Better and cheaper hotels around. I wish I never stayed.
negative	À notre arrivée, on nous a appris que le stationnement n'était que pour une seule nuit, alors qu'on y allait en croyant qu'il était inclus pour la semaine. La description mentionnait" stationnement gratuit, navette 24h/24h". Pas moyen de payer pour y laisser sa voiture. La réceptionniste nous a dit que plusieurs clients se sont fait prendre par le manque de précision au sujet du stationnement. Puis, aucune insonorisation! Les gens ont parlé fort dans le corridor toute la nuit. On entendait les portes claquer. On a donc très peu dormi.
negative	WE LIVED THE MOST TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE IN THIS HOTEL, AFTER CHECK IN WE ARRIVED TO THE ROOM AND FOUND TOILET USED, BED LINEN WITH HOLES, HEATER NOISY AND DUSTY, ALL AREAS OF THE HOTEL WITH SMOKE AND ELEVATOR VERY OLD AND UNSAFE!!!!
negative	TERRIBLE ENDED UP AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FILING A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE STAFF
negative	it so bad Hotel and Staff Do not speak English and Bad services and in Night only one Chef he cooking and he Delivery orders to Rooms Not fluent in dealing with people
negative	First room had a eye watering toxic smell. They neglected to tell us there was a noisy conference luau on the beach all night. The rooms had paper thin walls, could hear the neighbors and tv all night. For the price we would have expected very much more. Staff was not helpful at all, many hidden charges.
negative	He hotel had canceled my room and then tried to tell me they are fully booked . Keep in mind that I had already been charged $1200 and they had no intention of refunding me . They simply said call Expedia . I had to wait for over an hour And argue with 3 people before I got a room. 30 min late to my meeting . Don't waste your time or money with this place. 2 star hotel charging 5 star pricing anyways .
negative	I booked this hotel for 3 nights in early January. After check-in we found the room in dirty condition (garbage inside the closets and bathroom) further, it seems as the room had not been properly dusted/cleaned in a long time since most of the furniture had a layer of dust. Throughout my stayed, housekeeping only made the beds, no hand soap or basic amenities were supplied, nor the trash taken out. When I checked out (around 5am) the midnight receptionist was very much incompetent and wanted to charge for my credit card for the room, although I had shown him that the room was prepaid. Lastly, he overcharged around 40 euros for the breakfast and asked me to "take a few croissants and juice" for the overcharge. There are plenty of other similar priced hotels around the area - do yourself a favor and don't trash your money on this hotel.
negative	Terrible experience. Some ounces of milk, no coffee at the breakfast. Coffee maker in the room was full of mud.
negative	Horrible el cuarto apestaba y las sabanas y colcha también. no tenía refrigerador hable y les dije me dijeron horita le llevamos uno. Y si lo trajeron pero estaba liquiando y se mojo todo el piso nos dimos cuenta cuando mi hijo se resbaló.. no te dejan tener visitas después de las 8pm y tienes que traer un brasalete toda tu estancia en el hotel..parece carcel muchas reglas
negative	Hotel is rundown, tons of makntenance issues. Jacuzzis don't work. Staff is unmotivated. Food was terrible and they can't handle simple gluten free food. It was depressing, I feel bad for the place, there is no management. All the managers should be fired and the staff ahould be retrained.
negative	expedia wants an edited review. Sorry can't do that place was disgusting, people that worked there were not pleasant non employees hanging around the front desk just hanging around. Smell rooms gross unbelievable that this place got 3 stars from anyone Expect nothing but a room four walls and smell.
negative	This hotel has the worst management I've ever experienced. They told me that I could park in a lot that they were affiliated with and it consequently cost me a boot on my car. After I expressed this dilemma to management he specifically said "it's not my problem". Great way to do business. Never staying here and also informing anyone that I know to stay clear of this place. It is a scam going on!!
negative	This hotel doesn't deserve what I paid for ..room was not clean . Also bed was not comfortable. Shoer handle was not working.
negative	Room was dirty. Smelled like mold. Luke warm showers. Hair dryer didn't work. Hot tub and pool area was dirty. Hallways smelled. Not a pleasant stay at all. We will never stay at another travel lodge again.
negative	It smelled like stinky baby diapers! They also double charged me!
negative	Lengthy check in process. Awful terrain around resort. The cobblestone paths with gaping holes and uneven stones were unbearable. Very poor for seniors or women in 'evening' shoes. The the restaurants in site were actually very good, but the buffet is sub-par. The electricity didn't work in my bathroom or vanity and after reported to management - still never fixed. My friends whom I traveled with had a cockroach come up their shower drain and their safe would often malfunction. At one point we all lost water for about an hour. While the staff servicing the pools were great, there were not enough of them. The round bar was sad, didn't play music and overall very depressing. I'll never be back to this resort.
negative	Hotel in process of repairing water pipes and painting. Fumes from painting were over whelming. Water in hotel was sickening and caused discomfort during my stay. Hotel did not notify me until after I checked in that they were doing repairs and painting.
negative	가격도 비쌉니다 ᆞ시설리모델링이 필요합니다 ᆞ더이상 할얘기가 없습니다 ᆞ 다시는 안오겠습니다 ᆞ
negative	It was freezing the room was in poor condition very old and worn out accommodations highly recommend you go somewhere else.
negative	Tried to check in but no one was in site. I stood there in the lobby for 15 min and then I called the hotel. It was a hotel operator rep that answered and said the front desk associate must be on a break. There was no signage or anything saying be back in 15/on break/ring bell, nothing. The rep then made me pick up a phone in the lobby to call the hotel operator line. She answered "front desk" obviously not the front desk. I stated I was trying to check in and no one was in site along with 6 other guests behind me. I was told they would be right up, 10 min later they arrived this same situation happened when I tried no check out, NO ONE was present yet again. So I just walked out will not be back.
negative	We were assigned 3 rooms in Cottage T. The rooms in this cottage were in very poor condition. The carpet is very worn and needs to be replaced. The very dated bathrooms were in rough shape. We were concerned about mold. Although bed linens were clean, the overall condition of the room is nothing like the pictures they use on their website to promote their resort. It rained the last day. Due to massive leaks over the patio, the patio could not be used. There was also a leak in the room's sealing. We believe the smell of mold is coming from the ceilings and walls damaged caused by the leaks.
negative	Mosquito infested. Not the hotel that is discribed on the web site. Filthy and run down.
negative	No staff around upon arrival. Once found did not have reservation. Bugs in room. Knocks on door in middle of night.
negative	We arrived for a little work trip relief and everything looked great. The front desk then informed us that Expedia had the number we could fit in a room wrong and that they needed to charge us more per person. We waited a day to just talk to a manager about the problem and they were very cold and not willing to explain. Then, two out of our group got really sick after dinner one night and spent the next two days throwing up. It was not a vacation at all and we ended up spending a lot of extra money when things were not explained.
negative	I waited for for like 25 mins to check in. The clerk kept taking phone calls and I just stood there. I then get to my room and they just start started cleaning it from the previous guest. Another 25 mins. Pool is dirty and the hottube was not warm a single day I was at the hotel. My key cards kept losing its programming preventing me from getting back in to my room. So I get to wait in line at 10:30 at night while the single clerk checks in 4 sets of guests. Nearly 50 minutes later I have a new key card. It was not a very good experience.
negative	Uncomfortable beds, pillows. Very bad food. Just a very overall bad experience
negative	Only stay here if you have to. Is in the middle of a lot of creepy activity. Was here on a Monday night .. would've thought it was Saturday night outside. ALSO DOUBLE BILLED ME FOR THE ROOM ALONG WITH INCIDENTAL HOLD OF 100 DOLLARS.
negative	Terrible! Vacations just ruined. We were bitten by bed bugs. We stayed in room 245. Receptionist was just useless, didn't get any assistance or apology.
negative	Fire alarm went off twice during the night (midnight and 1:30am) for about 20-30 minutes each time. Front desk could not do anything about it until FD came. Tried contacting hotel about this twice since the incident occurred and still have not heard back. Did not get any sleep, uncomfortable knowing there was faulty fire equipment. Room itself had a weird set up and sink was not in the bathroom. Call me old fashioned but I prefer to wash my hands before exiting the bathroom (can only imagine the germs on that bathroom door). Breakfast was very limited, ended up going to the diner across the street to eat.
negative	So I booked this B&B for 3 nights. The room was nothing like the pictures. old, a bit dirty and uncomfortable. Bad beds which caused aching, a broken and dirty (fungus) shower and an uncomfortable smell every now and then. It's cheap, but not worth that money. The guy who gave us the keys was very nice, but that's about it.
negative	Unprofessional staffs will never ever stay or recommending this hotel to anyone
negative	When i arrived because of his manager i called to the police and after that police came there he becomes a little bit softer so the room was small and lots of stairs,breakfast wasnt good just location was good .thats it
negative	My worst hotel stay experience ever... - smelly, stinky and stained corridors - dirty bathroom - rusty faucets - no bed heads - bathroom tiled floors - broken air-conditioning Still need more points to decide? it was like a dirty storage room that was converted in a hotel room.. Included continental breakfast is a joke, you get a breakfast coupon to use in a bakery shop located inside the hotel building. I would have attached more photos but allowed to upload only 6.. I am surprised that Expedia is listing this as a "Beach Resort Hotel".. its worse than a highway motel !
negative	Vi havde en enkelt overnatning på hotellet inden hjemrejsen. Hele hotellet lugtede kraftigt af fugt, ligesom værelset gjorde. Madrassen på sengen var ikkeeksisterende og hård som bare pokker. Klimaanlægget larmede så voldsomt, at det var umuligt at sove. Vandet i bruseren kunne ikke reguleres, men var brand varmt. Kan ikke anbefales.
negative	Finding this hotel was a nightmare! We could see it but could not get to it as they were doing road construction. I know it was not the hotel's fault but for us, it was a great distraction. It was no wonder that they had a room.
negative	１、チェックイン時にエクスぺディアからなのも連絡がなくブックできていないと言われ直接貴社に電話を入れてやっと確認が取れた ２、チェックアウト時貴社の支払い確認が取れないので支払いを要求された この時も貴社に電話をして再度ホテルと話をしてチェックアウトできた 全く連絡などができていなく最低のホテルだった こんなホテル二度と止まらない なぜ客がホテルと貴社の連絡をしなければならないのか理解に苦しむ とにかく最低である
negative	Bedding blanket stained ugh!. Needs exterminator. All in room 109
negative	Lobby had a very strong perfume smell. Rooms are old with minimal updates. You could hear everything. They had outdoor entertainment that I could hear from my room. Not quiet or relaxing. They charge $40.00 to park the car. My sons watch was stolen from the car. Can not trust the valet service. Took over 40 minutes to get the car from the valet. Management did nothing to help with the stolen watch. Very disappointed!!!
negative	Room is big but the shower booth is so mini that you need to hold your breath to fit in. Relatively clean room. Super location next to subway, dept stores, opera garnier and so on. Wifi is super slow but being slow is not a problem. It was completely dead more than 50% of my time at hotel during my nine day stay. They told me its fixed nine times but it went back to death every time. Very frustrating !!!
negative	Great - welcoming engaged staff who well trained could respond to questions. Happy to help.
negative	After travelling 15 hours to get there 6 hours late and after mid night they indicated that their " booking system" had had a problem and my room was no longer available. Considered that i had already paid for it and had charged to my card i to was more than a little disappointed. Not staying their again.
negative	The sofa bed was hugely uncomfortable. The room was outdated. The facilities needed repairs. The refrigerator ran constantly, making it hard to sleep. We changed our hotel after single night. Got a room 1000% nicer for the same money.
negative	I never see hotel like that before water cold room cold
negative	no flat screen TV, maids forgot to put towles in room. Paint and tile in terrible condition. Rug is pre historic. I guess it's about the best you can get for $70 a night in a resort town.
negative	There was no hot water in the room and breakfast is not included
negative	I never even got to stay here & was not refunded my money. People are VERY rude, I'm VERY disappointed. This would've been my 2nd stay but oh well.
negative	I reserved this hotel on Expedia.com. I looked up pictures on the Internet and it looked like a great hotel close to the ski resort we were skiing at. Upon our arrival we noticed a very dark parking lot with a outdated hotel. The hotel advertise two queen beds with a pull out sofa, however the Hotel clerk told me that it would be $10 a night for a cot because their hotel was old and did not have pullout sofas. when I walked into the room it also was dark and had a weird smell. I immediately went to the front desk and asked to check us out and asked to cancel the next nights reservation. It has been over a week since our trip and we have still not got money back from Howard Johnson or Expedia. What an awful experience.
negative	The staff was rude. The hotel rooms have no outlets to plug stuff in, the shower had no pressure and the door knob kept falling off the door. I will never stay here again & I would not recommend anyone to stay here.
negative	I was sleeping and housekeeping knocked the door twice before check-out! She even got inside in the first one because I was sleeping and didn't hear that she was knocking.. When I said "what's going on?!" Then she said sorry and left the room.. I preparing my luggage in the second one. Super unprofessional and totally unaceptable!!! Also front desk wasn't much different either! The only good staff was room service, who brought food to the room. He was very nice and served professionally.
negative	This is not gold star hotel, real One star hostel :(
negative	*WARNING* Bed Bug Infested Mattresses in Rooms! This hostel offers No kitchen facilities and the staff are militant about not allowing anyone to have any access to the kitchen, you can't even get hot water from them. The host is also a strange character, beware going out with him and his staff at night to clubs because the next day they selectively ask guests to pay for the previous nights entertainment. A vehicle is necessary to stay at this hostel.
negative	The check in wasn't that bad. The outside looks alright and the inside of the room looked fine for a moment. We found a bed bug and my girlfriend found bites the next day. We asked the staff for a refund but haven't gotten it yet. Also, the staff didn't seem surprised about the problem.
negative	I will never stay again in this hotel Room not comfy and very hot Hallway smells so bad Foods not good Glasses and cups very dirty Front desk not help The view of the room sucked The street was not good for finding taxi we found many insects in the room
negative	Too out dated, stinks No Parking at all. Parking lot have been rented for other customer.
negative	Room number was taped to outside wall with fluorescent green duct tape. Refrigerator was filthy. Bathroom door would not properly close shut. Leaves and two fly swatters on floor of closet.
negative	Very friendly and welcoming woman at front desk but, the hotel stunk badly, the beds were tiny and uncomfortable. The room is way outdated, definitely shouldn't be charging $130 a night!!!!
negative	従業員の対応が悪く部屋の床には髪の毛がいっぱい落ちていた 部屋には窓もなく シャワーとトイレの間の仕切りカーテンもなくびしょびしょになった。
negative	真冬のバルセロナ観光のために、空港から近いという理由だけで予約した。 確かに空港からアクセスしやすい位置にはあったが、それを補うくらいバルセロナ中心街へのアクセスが悪い。ホテルの周囲にレストランなども一切ない。 部屋は清潔であったが、シャワールームがあまり綺麗ではない。 清掃が入った後にシャワールームの扉がなぜか壊れたまま放置されており、使いづらい思いをした。 さらに外出後に部屋に戻ると窓が全開になっており（恐らく清掃員が開けっ放しにした）非常に寒い思いをした。暖房を入れても23度を超える設定にはできないようにロックがかかってもいた。 総じて、宿泊は全くお勧めできません。
negative	Both bed mattresses were so worn out they visibly sloped towards each other and offered no support for the middle of the body. The one that was least worn out made my feet higher than my head. Had I known I could put pics on the review I would have taken better pics to show both beds and that I did nothing to cause or exaggerate the slope of the mattress. Additionally the bathroom had an irregular sound of a drip in a cavern although I could find no leaks in the room. Like clockwork, every morning at 5 am the toilet began aggressively glugging. Lastly the balcony doors did not seal. People talking on the patio 5 floors below sounded like they were just outside the door, especially when someone would cackle. The patio was used all night into early hours of the morning each night. Decent mattresses would have helped offset the noises. The mattresses were, hands down, the capstone of this experience.
negative	The gaming was terrible. I lost all my money. Lol. Just kidding. It was very noisy in are room at night. After a long day we could get no rest. Very good service though. The hotel is in great shape.
negative	Room lights didn't work I'm disabled and I had a room in the first floor but they put me on the second floor Beds are uncomfortable Staff was OK
negative	Floor in the room was sinking in, television remote didn't work, other rooms were able to look directly into shared bathroom, either heater would not turn off or AC would not turn on (couldn't figure out which one), window in room was so old you can hear traffic, people walking by and the MANY bars even with the window completely closed. Light from the street extremely bright and lit up the entire room. Music was blasting in the hotel lobby by the employees despite their many warnings to guests about noise violations. Actually left the same day we checked in because this hotel was so terrible. PLEASE go somewhere else!!!! I ended up paying a small amount extra for a room at the Redwood Inn and got our own bathroom, friendlier staff, pastries in the morning, bigger beds, and a MUCH quieter room.
negative	Woken up by a chain saw doing construction in the next room. No hot water or water pressure. Extremely noisy facing window. Weird chemical smell.
negative	The hotel needs a renovation smells like overwhelming air freshener throughout the hotel. The checkin lady was amazing in helping us with questions and accommodating. The rest of the staff doesn't care everyone is not helpful nobody can answer questions about restaurants, areas to see or if there is discounts in the surrounding area. The hotel is located at the end of the strip. The rooms are old and the hallways smell spend a little more money to stay somewhere else.
negative	we arrived at 13.52pm for a 14.00 checking, we were told that the room wasn't ready and to come back later. I noticed the over whelming smell of dogs , I looked around and saw what appeared to be staines in the entrance carpet judging from the smell I assume the 2 were linked I paid the car parking fee and left . So off we went with key in hand, when we arrived back to the room later and entered the room I couldn't even get in,the room was so small and ceiling low as it was in the loft, I went to complain and was told by a lad on reception id have to pay extra to upgrade to a sea view room, a bit pointless seeing as it was pitch black. Then a very rude woman asked what the problem was, I explained and she basically called me a liar saying we didn't check in earlier, needless to say we left immediately and stayed somewhere else. this place is a disgrace as long with the attitude,
negative	I booked a non smoking room , the staff said the hotel was fully booked and I hab booked a smoking room. I showed them me Expedia booking , the staff said their system said smoking. They only had a smoking room. I reluctantly took it as it was 1.00am my flight was 5 hours late. The room smelt so bad I gat a head ache. Complained, no help given. So checked out at 3.00pm and went and slapped on an airport seat, quieter, warmer, & smoke free. Appalling service no attempt to solve the problem or compensate.
negative	Dont be fooled by ad the first room had bugs no phone service. Towels dirty.
negative	The Westin in Cancun is classified as a 4 Star hotel which is NOT!! Our family were guests at this hotel from 12/28/16 to 1/3/17 and we were beyond dismayed about the the accommodations. The hotel lobby is outdated and does not reflect that of a luxury hotel. We have stayed at the JW Marriott and the Ritz in years past which are true 4 or 5 Star hotels. The room had broken furniture, tiles, a foul odor, and old decor. The food was expensive and of poor taste and quality. The surrounding gardens were not well groomed. In essence, the entire structure needs major rehab. The pool was cold and not heated. I do not recommend to stay there!!!
negative	I didn't like this hotel at all. Really bad service.
negative	Ugly rooms they ne remodelation. They have a nice lobby but rooms are disgusting
negative	The hotel location & free bus transportation are great but hotel staff are not up to the standards! Very poor customer service, not welcoming front desk reception, for 2 days they did NOT clean my room!!! Bad housekeeping services. Although I used to keep some tips at my room but unfortunately they are not up the standards. Dirty bathroom towels. They don't vacuum the room floor. The good side: excellent location, free bus transportation to Disney parks. Small coffee shops at ground level with all good foods & drinks.
negative	Wow this place is horrible. First you will be greeted by the 3 valets that are always at the front door, but when I say greeted I mean you will always be ignored. Then if you make it through the front doors, the front desk worker will try and sell you tours ever dang time. I get that they make commission, but come on! Once you get to your microscopic room, you will notice it is falling apart and dirty. Each room takes over an hour to "clean" because the cleaning staff takes naps on your bed. No joke, walked in on them taking a nap on the bed! What could of been the saving grace for this place is the rooftop bar with hot tubs. Problem is that the "hot" tubs are at 94 degrees max as they put consumer grade tubs in. And the bar, yeah no reason to have anyone working it when you could have a pile of valets doing nothing out front instead. Horrible place, cannot recommend spending more than $70 a night here.
negative	Ruined my wedding night! I have never endured such a sour experience at a hotel. There is way more better inns in the bay area.
negative	Oh if you need to leave like idk go buy some water, thats right you gotta pay extra to be abke to leave and come back. The staff was quite lazy and after inquiring to them about requests for a chair for the room or if I may just use the stairwell instead of there "scary death trap elevator" they informed me no and I just have to deal with it. I woke up with pink eye, their lovation is in the heart of the Tenderloin and if you dont know what that is, basiclly crack head central. So yea i went to a terrible hotel, paid terribly over what I felt was reasonable as far as there staff and amentariea and also got pink eye. All in All I had the worst time ever staying at COVA. Please I beg of you if you care for your health and your pockets(money) please go any where but here. Honestly, holiday inn would have been a better choice at this point.
negative	The Royal Lahaina should be embarrassed to place guests in Cottage T. Cottage T is in horrible condition. We were excited to stay at the Royal Lahaina but were extremely disappointed by the three rooms we were assigned. Cottage T should not be used until it is totally remodeled. The on-line pictures do not show the horrible condition Cottage T is in. The major leak over the patio made it impossible to use when it rained. The ceiling in room 8294 also leaked. The smell of mold is probably coming from the massive leaks over extended periods of time. To make matters worse, room 8293 had a serious cockroach infestation. This resort should immediately stop using this cottage until it can undergo a complete remodel. No customer should have to pay top dollar to stay in a resort that uses substandard facilities. When we brought these concerns to hotel staff they were completely ignored. Do yourself a favor, do not stay at the Royal Lahaina Resort.
negative	So I booked this hotel because of the ratings but it was not all it was cracked up to be. First this is not a VIP access hotel so if you are booking based off of that don't. Second the night front desk staff is mean and they are not willing to accommodate any of your needs. Second I had to call 2 times to have my room cleaned and I I didn't have the do not disturb sign on my door, and on the days the maid did come she tried to enter my room without knocking. Thank god i had the extra lock on the door or she would have caught me just coming out of the shower. The police were called here 2 times while I stayed one was for a fire that occurred in a room from a quest and another was for a fight that broke out. The walls are very very thin so I could hear everything the people next to me where doing The list goes on
negative	Arrived at 12:30 at night cop in lobby should have given us the first clue. Checked in and got into bed people above decided that was a great time to start partying. I thought we had cloggers above us. This continued for several hours. I realized it was Sat night let it go without much sleep. The room was really small compared to picture on web site. Next night was more of the same but sounded like they were moving furniture for room to clog. Would I recommend you hotel to anyone worst experience ever. When asked about my stay I told the manager he did not want to know. He said yes he did so told him. Why did I not call and complain really I did not want it to get any worse. Staff was wonderful breakfast for crap. Things did not work in room very bad experience.
negative	The staff was very very unhelpful, my tv wasn't working there was no iPod deck. The pool was so small and no privacy. I called to the front desk about my complaints but nobody cared about the tv
negative	It borders on a house for the homeless. In fact it may be just that. Best thing I can say is that I searched hard (really hard) for bed bugs and found none.
negative	a friend and I stayed at the Super 8 in Mansfield Ohio on 1/28/17. At approx. 3:30 am I heard a loud noise and all of a sudden i awoke when something landed on my back. I thought that maybe the building had collapsed. I lifted what was laying on me and crawled out of bed and turned on the light to find that the picture at the head of the bed had fallen off the wall and landed on me. the picture is approx. 4 by 5 feet. If I had been laying on my back it would have probably broke my nose or cut my face. the clerk kind of thought it was funny and took 25$ off my bill. I was dissapointed that they did not offer a total refund.
negative	Trash comes at 4:30 am every morning in front of the most expensive room they have. Staff had zero sympathy
negative	Checked out within 15 minutes after checking in. This hotel is nothing like their pics. It is old and run down and has very thin walls and no security. We could hear others conversations including baby crying. Not all staff members speak English. No individual thermostats in rooms. Uncomfortable and old bed. Very outdated. Needs to be gutted and rebuilt. Parking is on street with two hour meter limit. We didn't stay long enough to see much else. We checked out and ran!
negative	The noise from the fridge was really loud and annoying at nite. The heater is near the bed and it was loud too. The entrance door had some gaps and outside air was coming in. So needed to keep the heater on. The closet area was too dark even all lights on.
negative	It was a nasty dirty hotel the room smelled humid I had allergies until I left that hotel
negative	The hotel was terrible elevator don't work didn't get wat I was process from Expedia olsothe staff from hotel they were non polite at all I will not book again with this agency and I wodnt reccoment to any body.
negative	In spite of getting a "welcome" email before arriving at Caesars Palace there we no mention of how to park or how to check in. On arrival the signs regarding checking into the hotel were nonexistent apart from one in the parking area. We spent 30 minutes lugging luggage around before finally being directed to the right check-in place. Although this is a highly rated hotel there is no free coffee, water or tea provided in the room. The main curtain was broken at the top and the wall-paper coming away from the wall in the toilet.There were no instructions of any kind in the room regarding how to use the TV or Internet and most of the instructions that that were supposed to be on the "Menu" of the TV were "Not available at present."
negative	Online geboekt voor een 4 persoons kamer eenmaal aangekomen 1 x tweepersoons bed en 1 x slaapbank kortom gevangenis experiense in Madrid een nacht geslapen en daarna andere hotel gezocht
negative	Poeple where not nice, small bath rooms and gross and out dated rooms and building
negative	Although the hotel staff is very nice and accommodating, the rooms are terrible, beds are hard and uncomfortable with construction directly next door that will wake you at 7:00. Little Italy is great, this Hotel is not.
negative	Not for the price i pay for focused on beth tube did not work
negative	Our stay was horrible it was more like a motel dirty faucet it was broken toilet seat was broken but everything was just run down we wasn't satisfied at all
negative	Had two nights booked in this hotel. My worst experience I've ever had. Not sure if I will ever stay in an extended stay again. Started out pie no remote for TV. They were food crumbs all over the floor. Sticky substance on the counter which got all over my luggage. Dirty Q-tip left on the floor on the side of the bed. Hair stuck to the wall in the bathroom. Room looked like it hadn't been cleaned for a while. That was not the worst of it when I woke up in the morning and put the lights on immediately spotted two roaches was able to kill one. As I was getting dressed another ran out from under the bed. Took a photo of it. Expedia did a good job I'm getting my money refunded and rebooked at a Four Point Sheraton which is very nice.
negative	Worst staff ever! Rude, disrespectful and incredibly unaccommodating. The pictures are extremely misleading. This hotel's entrance is on a busy main road. Rooms are ridiculously small, have a strong map smell and no room amenities at all! Even the suite bed's are broken! Pool is hideous and so are the drinks. Food is old and they warm it up in a microwave, and still lay it on the table cold! Worst experience ever! The supervisor was ignoring all the calls from Expedia to avoid speaking with them! Made me and my friend feel unsafe and upset. Do not stay here! This is no way a 4* hotel - not even worth a 2*.
negative	Not clean need repairs bug found in bed ... no bathroom door
negative	No wifi. Horrible service. Did not receive the room we asked for and paid for.
negative	No hot water and no return call from management. Not able to shower in the am before leaving for the day. Management chose to ignore the problem instead of addressing it and completely disregarded my report. I will never stay there again.
negative	It is bad hotel even the parking cost more then the room's fare
negative	Desagradable el pasillo olia feo, estabamls en una zona de no fumar y olia demasiado a mariguana, preferimos salir a otro hotel poca seguridad e higiene en el lugar
negative	The noise from the TVs in the bar under our room was horrible. I asked them kindly to turn the sound down to no avail. I asked the hotel manager 3 times for assistance and he said he would take care of it he didn't. Friends of ours had stayed the night before we did, and suggested we stay on the pool side. They said loud pool parties kept them awake all night.
negative	The room was dirty, the bathroom had fungus, the toilet did not work, the towels were dirty and the sheets of the bed were dirty as well. Extremely bad price to quality ratio.
negative	The hotel is located at Japan Town. The hotel is currently under renovation because it's outdated. Our room is very small with 2 double beds and very dark. The bathroom sink clogged and night stand lamp does not work but no one came to fix the problems.
negative	Mal servicio al cliente los reseccionistas no sirven no tienen paciencia no saben explicar nada te hablan con pesima actitud jamas bolveria a ese hotel ni mucho menos lo recomendaria los cuartos estan sucios apestan a mariguana cigarro son deprimentes necesitan remodelacion y peor de todo estan caros horrible muy mala experiencia me siento traumada..
negative	To expensive and foods were terrible Really really shocked
negative	Tv and remote didnt function correctly. Cobwebs all over the room. Entire 5th floor smelled like pot. Cheap bulbs hardly lit the room, even with every light on. Had to use a flash light to see what was in my suitcase.
negative	Very loud and old plus nearby have a train tracks buuuu. Buuuu aver 30 minute
negative	Never ever stay in this hotel again or recommend to anyone and don't trust the picture that they put in there The worst hotel I ever stay.
negative	Couldn't even take a shower. One of the two sinks didn't work. So old looking. Blinds didn't work properly in such a busy street it felt like we were sleeping during the day.
