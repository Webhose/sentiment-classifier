positive	I love how easy it is to use and I love the color options. I just wish that there was a redo but just in case you hit undo too many times and I wish there was an option to see your recently used colors so you don't have to spend as much time searching for the matching swatch so you can use it again. I love how there are both kids and adult designs. Other than those minor changes, I love the app and would totally recommend it.
positive	Great fridge!. Great refrigerator that includes plenty of storage space and customization of shelving to hold bulky items. Plenty of door storage and the freezer has adjustable shelving as well. 
positive	Does what it says, and it's free. one thing I don't understand is, I thought taking an AVI to MP4 would compress the file, but it always ends up much larger than the original; keep this in mind if disc space is at a premium :)
positive	Perfect companion to the tv. The tv mount was easy to put up. Perfect. Just what I needed. 
positive	Always a good bet I've used these before and this was to replace an older pair I have. They are no nonsense and do the job. They are pretty easy to get on and off, although they don't work with certain style shoes. But those aren't the ones you should be wearing when it's Neighborhood On Ice. 
positive	Great DVD player for the price.. Although it does not upscale to UHD, it works well for standard 1080p programming. 
positive	Great Product. Use them almost daily for work and the gym. Haven't had any issues yet. Battery life is excellent. 
positive	Great Bluray player. Works as advertised. Easy setup has an output for an audio jack separate from the HDMI. 
positive	Awesome, Dyson believer, worth every penny! My second Dyson. My first lasted 11 years, and really still eorks, a cosmetic crack. Once you get a Dyson NOTHING ELSE will do. James Dyson is a brilliant inventor. Truly love all products by Dyson. Worth EVERY PENNY 
positive	Five Stars So far so good. Have hardwood floors with a husky and two cats . 
positive	Real cool stuff. Great looking Real cool stuff. Great looking. Super suction and easy navigation. Better than any top brand. You'll not be disappointmented at this product. 
positive	perfectly scans all the possible text from the photo..but don't rate it bad if it can't read your scribbles :P It's perfect
positive	the app is brilliant. but can you add support for extracting text in Persian?
positive	Five Stars Exactly what I orderedSafe but comfortable 
positive	Cardinal took the time to find a mortgage refinance that would work for me, when other companies asked a few questions and said " sorry, nothing we can do." Cardinal emplyees were always professional and encouraging!!
positive	Stick it to the man!. I love this app! Stop giving your money to greedy hotels and give it back to the people in the city your visiting! It's 100 times more convenient than a rental car! 
positive	It is a good place for the price it was offered at. Clean room, decent furniture and fixtures. Metro station is 10 minutes walk. Nice tourist attractions at walking (20-30 minutes) distance.
positive	Great and awesome looking Fridgr. Awesome fridge so far. Looks great and seems to easily stay cold 
positive	Very happy with this product, quality and price 
positive	Love apple products. Got this for my dad ( not a young duck anymore). He is able to use the cell for more than calling which was important to me. 
positive	Simplest way to secure your connection. If you're in the US, security and privacy are going to become far more valuable in the coming future and a VPN is an effective first step. For iOS users, this is a fast and easy way that's as elegant as the OS you're using.Don't trust the others, most being based in China where user security is even more compromised. Rely on a VPN based in the EU, ideally Switzerland, where privacy laws are far more stringent than the US, whose laws are eroding by the day. 
positive	I like the app because its easy to use I don't like the part where you cant add a text
positive	Great and compact computer. I like how light the computer is I can take it with me anywhere. It's still got a high processing power and has great resolution. I ordered the certified refurbished and I could not recommend any more. Saves some $$$ too. 
positive	Wonderful app that allows user to log all classes they have. It allows the user to create a schedule of homework allowing them to relax and accomplish everything they have to do. Sometimes app won't sync properly to my phone, but usually a wonderful, very helpful app.
positive	Speedy drive. Easy to install and you might need to buy additional brackets if your putting in a desktop slot. 
positive	Love this computer. The smaller size would usually turn me away but i now love the size and thinness of it. i also love the color options 
positive	Great notepad, checklist, etc. Using a variety of features. Like that it syncs so I don't lose info between phones. Handy app and user friendly. Can't believe its free!
positive	Canon Ink. The ink works well with Canon printer and has a larger capacity. 
positive	I am originally from Chicago and I am listening to the Smooth Jazz Air Chicago. I feel like I'm home. What a nice way to chill. Reminds me of Cold outside and Cozy warm inside, if you know what I mean...
positive	Rate: 5 stars -Phone order for RX refill. Customer service rep was very friendly and professional and efficient. I ordered a three month supply for my pets prescription for Cushing's disease
positive	Granddon happiness Grandson loves it. Looks forward when his time to play on any electronic he has. He picks Nintendo 3ds so he can play the sun 
positive	I've been using Spending Tracker for a couple of years to track my checking account. I liked the convenience of having it on my mobile devices to be used whenever I need to. I just bought a new computer and decided to see if they had the app for my computer and discovered they did! On the computer, I am able to do things I could not do on a mobile device, like tracking multiple accounts. This app is easy to use and is synced to all my devices, so I always have the correct balances available. It's one of my most used apps and my favorite by far.
positive	My son just turned a month old today and we have had so much trouble fining a formula he would tolerate. We started out on the Enfamil Newborn, then switched to Enfamil gentle ease and it wasn't working so the doctor recommended Enfamil AR, after 5 days of that not working at all (he would cry after every feeding, and vomit) we tried Prosobee and it has worked great!
positive	Great product. This is an amazing product to help you get fit. Everything you need comes with it. 
positive	The app is fantastic. They have great how to videos on their site as well.
positive	Great disc for my kids. Its a good sports disc my kids play with and good for playing at home 
positive	Cool!. I enjoy the program intervention, among others. Since downloading the app I can binge-watch all of the episodes I've missed throughout the years. I do wish I could zip past the commercials like I can with my DISH remote control. I'm going to start checking out all of the A&E programs and find all my old favs! 
positive	It's a huge cathedral with a fantastic exterior and beautiful inside. Very interesting visit and experience.
positive	Great computer. Love this computer. The keyboard took a little getting used to because the keys are very flat and don't push as easily, but that is something you can get used to. Other than that, I love everything about it. 
positive	If your baby is crawling you must get these. Allows baby to crawl easier than the swaddler diapers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Purchased three a year ago for my bass boat and they are going strong. Purchased two more recently for my camper trailer to run in parallel for longer lasting power so that we may boondock for longer periods.
positive	So comfortable and stylish! Perfect for rainy day or snowy day!
positive	Very flattering fit and slims the belly, hips, legs. Got a better deal and service with Zappos than the DL1961 website.
positive	Inexpensive and perfect for my 50" 4K TV. I bought this to hang my Sony 50" 4K TV on the wall in our bedroom. It was SUPER easy to install and holds the TV securely and close to the wall, but is easy to pull out to add new HDMI devices. 
positive	It's very easy to makes notes and organize them. It might be a little cumbersome if you have alot of notes under one tab though.
positive	Very quick and easy to do edits for videos. Literally takes 5 minutes
positive	Light and simple. I decide to replace my Mac after 7 years. This computer is super light and the color is a plus! The only thing I didnt like is, I had to buy a USB adapter. 
positive	Very happy with the tablet Super tabletGreat screenGood performanceIncredible value 
positive	Really works well! Purchased as a gift for our daughter.She loves loves loves it.Light. Easy to use. Incredible ability to pick up dog hair. Attachments are well designed to do specialized jobs. 
positive	Five Stars Delivered in time and great unopened product! 
positive	Five Stars I absolutely love it... it may be small but it is much louder than any regular sized stereos 
positive	Great blu ray player. This is a great blu ray player and very easy to set up. The salesperson was very helpful in making my decision. 
positive	Ads removed. Everyone, we've turned off all the ads to find the offending popups. Twitter (our ad network) has been notified, but we'll leave them off until we can be sure all is fixed. 
positive	Love my phone. I love my new phone samsung galaxy s7 edge unlocked 
positive	Best airline app. I have tried apps from the leading airlines as well as from low cost airlines. This app is by far the best I have seen. The checkin process is simple, and you can even add people who didn't buy the ticket at the same time. The app will take care of seating you together.During reservations all the options that a full site offers are available:- seat selection- upgrade options- meal options- extra requests- young children needsAt checkin the app makes it easy to add the plane tickets to the Apple Wallet.To manage the frequent flyer card, the app offers many options:- use frequent flyer miles to purchase tickets- near real time membership status- a life size copy of the membership card- profile updatesThe app has gone a long way in the last 3 years, kudos to the developers. Keep up the good work! 
positive	Best music app. This app, pocket tube, is (in my opinion) the best music app on the App Store. It is extremely simple and allows you to save music offline. I really enjoyed the free version, that when I got the money to buy the premium, I did not stop to think twice about it. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a good quality music app. You shouldn't have any trouble at all with the app. Premium is most definitely worth the $2.99 it costs. Once more, I would recommend this app to anyone since it is so reliable and such high quality. 
positive	Had to re-watch some movies to confirm stuff in the game, but it's accurate. Holy crap the hard mode, is hard. Great fun though if you're familiar with Catch Phrase and really like star wars. 
positive	It was pretty smooth for me... i don't have a lot of practice with editors, just needed a BW for a frame... Thank you Queenloft for this simple professional program!
positive	Super comfortable, supportive and warm. Not much to look at but they're slippers so what do you expect. I am normally a shoe size 9 but needed a 10 in these.
positive	I'm still a bit undecided on these, they are as pictured but all the comments about sizing I'm not sure if they are truly a 1/2 size small or not, I ordered a 1/2 size up and still debating. They really are beautiful and high quality boots , not sure if i'm a fur off the rim kind of girl. Certainly high quality and worth the money although I think I would prefer a wool insert vs this furry stuff. The outer canvas and shimmer is extremely lovely, that I do love. I'd also recommend: Timberland
positive	Simple and user friendly. Was very simple to install and use, so far so good! 
positive	Just what we needed. This blue ray player was just what we needed. We didn't need any new cables as this was basically the same type as we had before. 
positive	It's amazing. I absolutely love this fridge 
positive	Love this...any one not using picsart ....is sooo missing out. It is so fun , easy to use and has hidden suprises every where for your phone an other devices...
positive	Great app!!!! Also have it on my Xbox one, worth the upgrade with no ads and plus on Xbox one it will update my background daily for me. Also love space science and all the information you can learn from this application.
positive	Move over SONY, SAMSUNG'S THE NEW SHERRIFF IN TOWN. For the longest time we bought TVs that were PANASONIC or SONY. Since moving into a new home over a year ago, we were blown away when we saw the picture quality on SAMSUNG. We purchased a 55-inch model and that one went into the living room. The screen on our 40-inch SONY that was formerly our living room set, was damaged in storage, so back we went to buy a 48-inch SAMSUNG for the "man cave," End result - we are thrilled with BOTH, and look forward to many enjoyable years of viewing in the future! 
positive	Get one you'll love it! I love my kindle fire 10! I read books, watch movies, read the newspaper,read my email, listen to a radio sports show, and download and listen to music on it. 
positive	Great phone. Great product. User friendly. I love new features that are added in I phone 7 
positive	Easy to use, I wish custom category's could be created though
positive	I recently learned about Haflinger slippers and quickly ordered a pair in navy. I LOVE these slippers . They are a little firm in the sole, which is just right, and they don't make that slap-slap noise when you walk. They "grip" the road so I never feel like I'm going to slip on the stairs, and they're so cozy! I fervently hope these don't go out production as I will definitely be ordering a replacement pair when these wear out 
positive	Great Phone. I purchased a phone through the online website. I ordered and went to store to pickup. 
positive	My mom. Got for my mom she loves her new phone great there are classes to help her w it 
positive	I really like this app. I am very forgetful and this helps so much. I like that within the app there is not only a selection for notes but for lists, grocery shopping, etc. Works very well with no glitches. Also, you can use it offline.
positive	Awesome. This app is truly amazing I've tried a number of free texting app because my phone is currently off and no longer receiving messages and every time I download a free texting app it want to text my phone for a number conformation but this one doesn't all I needed was my email and a password that I could remember and I was able to text. 
positive	Great for my animations. I bought an iPad just a few days ago, and also purchased the drawing pencil for the iPad so that I could work on my animations. I downloaded this app because it was free and I'm not sure if I want to go down the graphic designer career path so I didn't want to spend any extra money at this point.I have to say best decision ever. This app has everything I could possibly need. I have not drawn in a couple years so having an app like this instead of using just pencil and paper really helps because believe me when I say I have made a lot of mistakes in my animation that I need to erase, and it's tons better to do it on an electronic device instead of constantly using an eraser on paper. 
positive	I pulled these out of the box, put them on, and haven't taken them off much since. They are amazing! I would normally not spend so much on slippers or any shoe but my feet need it, especially as I get older. I have arthritis in the big toe of 1 foot. These slippers offer great support, enough stiffness in the sole, and a roomy toe box to make them perfect for my situation. These are totally worth the money. I love the feel of wool, just wool, all wool, around my feet. I normally would take a size 40 but ordered a size down after reading reviews. Size 39 is perfect with thin socks , but tight with thick socks . But I don't need thick socks with these babies!
positive	It's a great cell and a good camera. I loved it , easy to use . 
positive	Nice place, sink and shower drained slowly, but was a nice place with exceptional service.
positive	easy to use and affordable. would highly recommend this to any one.
positive	Love it. I read the directions and followed them. It took 20 min since I read them twice. No problems. Vizio 60" M-D1 and 45" 5.1 soundbar both from Costco. Looks great, sounds great. Pairing my iPhone was a snap. The menu for adjusting the picture and sound are well thought out; I was actually impressed. If you take 15 min to read the directions, you will have no problem. If you just start hooking stuff up ... you will likely end up frustrated. 
positive	Easy setup. Easy setup and secures to the wall very well. Would buy for a medium tv. 
positive	Certainly the best hotel we have ever stayed in. It was the occasion of a special celebration and the staff ensured it was very special. They were very professional whilst being attentive but sensitively unobtrusive, warm and welcoming. You would be hard pressed to find better. Our suite was roomy and of a very high quality. Very highly recommended.
positive	My middle school aged son LOVES these boots ! He said they are very comfortable
positive	I really like the Bloomsbury and it was nice to find a comfortable but human-sized hotel in the centre of London. The price is reasonable. Breakfast is not included but can be bought for an extra fee (a little pricy though), or you can simply go to one of the nice cafés in the area. We'll most probably stay here again.
positive	Easy to navigate. Easy to navigate, clear, fast, seems not to crash like several other airline apps. 
positive	These wipes are hospitals first choice for a reason. My baby is allergic to anything but these wipes have never given us problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	My favorite app!!. This is by far the best music downloading app out there. It's super easy and organizes the music by attic for you, something veeeery few apps do, if any. I've been using it for years now and it's the absolute best. There are times where they update and remove the app from the store to do so, which messes up its function a bit, but it's usually back up within a day. Overall, 100% worth the three dollars. 
positive	Excellent. This device is fantastic. It works perfectly and works very well with Plex 
positive	Solid SSD. So far so good. Installed this into a desktop PC and did a clean re-install of OS. Kept all data files on HDD. Easy install and no issues so far. Definite speed improvement as compared to running OS on HDD. Samsung Magician tool is pretty nice and simplifies configuration and set up. 
positive	Really good speaker. My teenager wanted a "good" portable speaker ... Really good speaker. My teenager wanted a "good" portable speaker and I was hesitant about ordering without being able to listen to one first but it had good reviews so I thought I'd try it. I have not regretted purchasing this speaker. This speaker has a great sound. Very please with this purchase. 
positive	These shoes are soooo comfy and so cute. I was looking for a pair of cute sandals for a festival and purchased these and didn't regret it one bit. The comfort of them is amazing. Most sandals tend to give me blisters after a while, but there always hold up and do the job! I love them!
positive	easy to download and works wonderful with my Medici downloads which I had trouble using in Windows 10
positive	First IPhone purchase. Really enjoy given this as a gift to my brother, he was very surprised 
positive	Second pair that I've bought for my husband. He loves these after long days standing at work. The first pair were an 11 wide (he has wider, flat, Fred-flintstone-like feet). I couldn't fid the wide the second time and so I got him a 12 regular size and they fit just as well, if not better. I'm thinking I need to see what SOREL offers for women, they look really comfy. The bottom is also very nice, as it is a textured rubber, but not extremely thick. This makes them slip-resistant, and lightweight. I'd also recommend: DC Villian, Clarks , Uggs
positive	I give this app 5+ stars because you can make a person/avatar that can be just like you. I also give it 5+ stars because you can be creative and set your mind free with your thoughts and ideas so that your avatar can be just like you. It would be better if you make a lot of stuff free for the newbies (like me...). And also make more Sets of clothes (maybe more tuxedos, gaming sets, etc.). I would recommend this to people who have first started using an Xbox account, and/or want to make a new one. The other good thing about this app is that you can use it on the go.
positive	I am a collector of boots with a closet overflowing. I own 5 pairs of Stetson boots and they are the most comfortable out of the box boots I have ever purchased. These boots are very neutral in color so they go with a lot. I get lots of compliments. They are a little bit country and a little but rock n' roll. True to size. I'd also recommend: Corral West, Sorel
positive	I was very surprised by how quickly they responded to a glitch that I had with the program. They were more than helpful. They were appreciative of my email and generous with a cure for the problem. It is possible to get great service on the internet. Who would have thought? Thank you support team! My wife and I recently retired and this program keeps us up to date on how well, financially, that is going. Its in a format that we can understand.
positive	Eric went above and beyond his job duties. He is extremely professional, courteous and very efficient at what he does. He is very empathetic about his clients needs and ensures that he meets his clients expectations. I am very grateful to have had Eric Jones as our Loan Advisor and I would highly recommend him to anyone.
positive	fun for everyone Hey, its catch phrase, fun for everyone! 
positive	Great entertainment for a small dinner party This is our third catch phrase game. With a group of people this game becomes hilarious. Great entertainment for a small dinner party! 
positive	The adults have fun with it as well My daughter loves this game. The adults have fun with it as well. 
positive	I kept these slippers but they're not perfect. Fit true to size and good support but I find the wool slightly rough and the middle seam is uncomfortable. As another reviewer mentioned this does become less noticeable with a few wearings but next time I buy slippers I will look for something softer and no middle seam. I'd also recommend: Ugg
positive	Great product. Is nice to hace a Samsung product at home . I love it 
positive	Nice washer. This is a really nice washer, easy to use and easy to install. 
positive	Beautiful. Didn't want the typical ice and water in outside as it cuts down on door space. Product well made, ice maker is great and one touch water dispenser is awesome and inconspicuous. Another winner! 
positive	My first home purchase. Had no idea where to start. Thanks to Mr Brown, my whole experience was pretty effortless. Mr Brown made sure every aspect was covered and explained. I got a fantastic rate, Mr Brown knows his job well. I have recommended him to several people.
positive	College kid. Bought to back up my sons lap top, easy to setup and use. 
positive	HBO Go is just what the doctor ordered. As proprietary as the Apple Empire is, I was shocked to see them not drop hbo go upon the birth of hbo now, go's evil big step brother.. of course, which is only, subscription based only... to get piggy back off of my existing satellite account is beyond stellar! Thank u apple for your part in helping to eradicate $100+ cable/satellite contracts! Streaming media is here, and it appears here to stay! 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -I was looking around for a good offer that was legitimate in unlocking my Galaxy s6 edge locked on Bell mobility. I found several sites but then stumbled across cellphoneunlocker.com. They have excellent service and provided me with a method of tracking the status/progress of the unlocking, and had great customer service too. I got my unlock code around 10 hours which makes it really worth the money. Overall it was great and I would definitely recommend this!
positive	Rate: 5 stars -My daughter and I joined in December hoping to find a program that we enjoyed and wouldn't get bored with. We found it at ILKB. The workouts are amazing and the staff there are phenomenal.
positive	Awesome. This phone is the best phone I have ever had and I won't change it for any other phone I hope you enjoy it if u buy it and you won't regret it I promise 
positive	awesome laptop. Nothing better than this in its class. Yes, the price is a little high, but if you find it on sale, it's the best. 
positive	Great and handy. I use it very often for quick note taking, great and easy access features for any quick and every day use. I don't think it needs any improvement. Works every time love it! 
positive	love the variety! would like more color choices, but other than that, very nice app!!
positive	Good replace for old tv. I purchased this product for my father and he likes to watch. 
positive	Love these slippers ! The wool/acrylic blend inside makes these very, very warm. I also wear socks , so I never have that sweaty, scummy wool problem. I replaced a pair of sorel manawan, which are exactly the same, except the manawan comes up your ankle, making them harder to get on & off. And these come up your heel just enough that they are easy on/off, and also stay on when walking. I also typically wear 11.5-12.5 (depending on the brand/style), but these I wear an 11, which fit perfectly until the pile flattens, then are a smidge loose. Also, footbed has some molded arch support , but could be more (I have low arches/flat feet). Wish they would sell replacement footbeds, as they're what wear out first.
positive	Strong transmitter and receiver. With little obstruction I've had no issues with the set except that the transmitter does produce a good amount of heat. I haven't had issues yet but I can see how it could easily overheat. 
positive	I love how it gives you different colors so you know what one to look for.
positive	These are our favorite wipes. They were the first ones we used when our son was born and we have tried several other kinds since (we were gifted many brands). These continue to be our favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Great Harddrive. Worked great to replace my hardrrive in my MacBook that was going out. My MacBook was only 18 months old. I am very pleased with my computer it is like a brand new one. 
positive	Professional service provided in a knowledgeable and fast manner.
positive	Good product Took a while to get used to but great 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -these guys are awesome.I went online and before I was done, I got a call from KEVIN he came in took control of my computer and BAM my computer is up and running THANKS ITSatisy !!!!
positive	Five Stars Good product nice protection for my roomba 
positive	Does everything YouTube does and more...can listen to a stream with the screen off. Need to pay for Google Play music to do that on Android. Love the cast feature, works great.
positive	Five Stars They work as expected. A non-expensive hand held to help teach my children how to play. 
positive	At my baby shower I received 90% Huggies wipes and a few pampers. I went through the Pampers and started using the Huggies, I got through 1 1/2 packs of wipes and saw my son was getting a bad rash. Fast forward all Huggies got returned and replaced with Pampers. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	In the British museum neighborhood and close to a couple underground stations
positive	Keyboard is great. I've been using the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard for close to 20 years. They continue to get better and stay durable. I've been very happy use them on all my computers. 
positive	Amazon Fire TV is the way to go! My husband and I decided to "cut the cord" but still wanted (or HE) still wanted ESPN and we love all the perks of Amazon Prime. We tried Sling on Roku and it was ok, then we decided to try Apple TV. It was a step up but still a little hard to use. We got the Amazon Fire TV and switched to DirecTV Now and it's great!! The remote and guide is SO much better! WE LOVE IT! 
positive	Excellent For anyone who makes candles or soaps, this is a must have!!!! Excellent 
positive	Great Communication! Knowledgeable! Courteous! Patient!
positive	Awesome. I love the Fitbit brand and how easy it is to use. I actually returned my Apple Watch for this Fitbit! 
positive	Great product. I would highly recommend it. Love Fitbit! I bought this one for a gift. I'm ready to upgrade myself. 
positive	Great. 2nd Apple Watch, battery and screen brightness much better 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -National animal hospital is exceptional. They basically do all the work for you, from faxing your veterinarian, to e-mailing when you need refills. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. If it wasn't for you i would probably not be able to afford my dogs prescription every month. Thank you thank you.
positive	Excellent. Great product! I already owned the fire stick and wanted to upgrade and I am satisfied with my purchase! 
positive	This is a good app, it is very easy to use. There are only two things I don't like about it; you can only have one avatar at a time, and I cannot get it to download anything from the avatar store. Other than that, it's great!
positive	Great ssd. Awesome fast and reliable hardrives Samsung never disappoints 
positive	Dr. Darch and his team are excellent. I have used Dr Darch for all my pets and NEVER had a bad experience. 
positive	Fast and easy. Swapped out hdd with this ssd. Boot up time is lot faster. Installing was a breeze. 
positive	Have visited APOD www site for years, now I use this to see APOD on the Lock Screen...makes it easy for me to decide when to visit www site or forum for more detailed discussion. Thanks for this app! :-)
positive	Perfect for a romantic weekend getaway. My husband loved the 70" TVs and the service, and I loved the food and comfort of this luxury hotel.
positive	this is only coffee I drink all day long my coffee pot is on all day for any one to stop by it ready
positive	Love it. Love this mac bought it for my daughter and she was super happy 
positive	Used these to avoid diaper rash and so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Surprised just how much fun our family had with this Christmas present already Surprised just how much fun our family had with this Christmas present already! We keep it accessible for quick-use at random opportunities. Very pleased! Perfect for our family of four (including two kids - 10 and 7) 
positive	I love my new Timberlands ! I am a size 7 in women and I ordered this boot in a boys size 5 and it fits perfect. It is so comfortable and definitely keeps my feet warm while being super stylish. I am very happy with this purchase!
positive	My oldest daughter had sensitive skin and only could use these wipes without a diaper rash. She is now 5 and I still use them on her! My other daughter 18 months old has Eczema and I can only use these Sensitive wipes on her. I love then and i do not think I will ever stop buying them even after the youngest is fully potty trained! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Movie goers will recognise this unique paneled painting from Monuments Men. The photo I include is a replica on display on the right side of the church in it's own chapel.The real Van Eyck painting is at the rear of the church, has a small entrance fee, and photo's are not allowed. Truly a fascinating piece of work
positive	Very classic and functional slipper! I had some doubts when I ordered this, as it looked a little frumpy, but it has a nice cut and fits the foot nicely. Traction on the bottom, slips on and off easily, and is total comfort. What more can you ask of a slipper? I'd also recommend: OluKai , Ugg
positive	installation was fast and easy. Only problem to much to choose from installation was fast and easy. Only problem to much to choose from.Still learning will give up date once Have chance to use it. 
positive	The refi process with Amerisave is smooth and easy. The people are great to work with. I have refinanced with them three times and I keep coming back because of their excellent service, fast respond, and great people. I highly recommend them for new mortgages as well as refi's.
positive	I can use for put letters in the pictures , I love it
positive	C'EST COOL POUR TIRER SUR UNE CIBLE ET J'ADORE CE MÉGA NERF
positive	Very cute and just right for rainy days or trips to the creek.
positive	Five Stars Love it. Almost like to vacuum now. 
positive	Superb sound while working out, keeps me pushing.. These Beats Powerbeats3 Wireless Earphones are very stable and comfortable. 
positive	I've searched them all and used most. This one is the best, especially syncing with my Windows Phone.
positive	I have just gotten started but so far so good. I was working jig saw puzzles and was tired of them so this is a nice change.
positive	Best diapers we have used, great for my on the go baby. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Cool. Nice app, lots of songs and videos to choose from. Highly recommended. Wish I could turn off my screen with out it shut off though 😕 
positive	Very pleased with the care I got. The doctor sent me to Vitamin Cottage to pick up a few things that helped me and the treatment I got. It has been a month since I have had my last treatment and it wa s my best month in years. My asthma and digestive issues have not bothered me. I'm feeling in control of my health thanks to Dr. Terence. 
positive	Great item. I live this item my children think it one of the best purchases I have made 
positive	I like that it is really easy to use, it takes me right to the action as far as what I'm looking to accomplish for videos
positive	Ok. I really liked it I bought is as a gift for my dad and he loved it 
positive	I have completely taken control of my spending habit with this app. It is convenient and is accessible to all my devices. When tax time comes around it is especially helpful as all of my expenses for the year are just a couple of clicks away! This is a very useful app.
positive	good set help a lot to clean the window curtings 
positive	Adult Coloring Book is great for simple easy to do drawing. It is easy and simple and relaxing to use for frustration release and for time killing. you can save your picture you made and start over for new one if you like. it is wonderful for me.
positive	Gorgeous shoe! Classy, work or date appropriate. I agree with the other reviewers that it runs 1/2 size big. I typically wear a 9.5, so ordered both the 9.5 and 9. Nine was perfect, I tried it on even after working all day (i.e. swollen feet), it's great. The heel hight is sexy, yet comfortable, because it's very stable. Love this shoe, and I will buy more. I'd also recommend: Sam Edelman
positive	Great product. This is my second Apple Watch Sport. Upgraded to Gen 2 and love it. 
positive	Great Big screen TV. Super clear, beautiful color. Great Big screen TV. Super clear and beautiful color! The Geek squads, the Delivery Team and the Installation team were BOTH professional, obviously experienced in their fields of expertise and very respectful of my family, home and my pets. 
positive	Excellent. This phone is remarkable I love it love it love it. I highly recommend anybody that's debating The purchase of it. 
positive	Big upgrade from the 5!. This was a Christmas gift for my dad and he absolutely loves it. Camera is incredible 
positive	Jamie has been excellent to work with. I went into this whole process with low expectations and she managed to exceed all my expectations and more. She walked me through the whole process, explained it to me in plain English and never pressured me or made me feel like I was a number. She put a lot of effort in making sure this process went smoothly and ensured that the end result was positive. She was very responsive to my questions, no matter what time of the day. I would recommend her 100%. She was awesome and I'm very fortunate to have had her as my loan officer. I'm a very happy customer ... Read More
positive	RefiJet is aptly named! I spoke to Jim Garey late one night and was signing documents the very next morning. Speedy, efficient, simple...can't think of enough superlatives to describe the start to finish process that I enjoyed while working with Jim at RefiJet. As a mortgage loan officer myself, I know how tricky it is to navigate the "banking" world, Jim made it seem so simple that I would recommend him to anyone in need of a carefree auto refinance. Thanks to Jim and the team at RefiJet for saving me a fortune on my car refinance and making it easy to do ... Read More
positive	Faster than the old model. Haven't had any issues...great product....no need for the amazon fire box, these are better imo 
positive	Visited several time, and the last time there was a very good atmosphere! Cocktails as always- wow! Must have
positive	Great Vacuum! Amazing vacuum!! How nice to have a vacuum thats actually picks everything up. I have a dog that sheds and this does a great job keeping my floors clean. 
positive	Nice room. Clean and practical, but shuttle service didn't work. Called ahead to get information about the shuttle. Was told it arrived at the various terminals in 30 minute increments. Arrived at 8:00 p.m. Called again to find out exactly where to pick it up at terminal 3. Station 17-18. No shuttle arrived. Waited 40 minutes and took a cab. Tried to get the shuttle at 6:30 a.m. the following morning, It didn't turn up so took a cab again. Please do not advertise a shuttle service when the system doesn't work. I will report this information to Trivargo. Many foreign visitor rely on shuttle service.
positive	TV in the room did not work. Bathroom needs update. For those with allergies, I would encourage another hotel.
positive	Great. My son is really enjoying his I phone 7. We love our phones 
positive	I love that you can type anywhere and it creates a moveable box. Organizing it by categories and subject and pages are color coded and simple to move around or delete. It's so easy to copy over pictures and the snipping tool it comes with makes copy-paste much better for all types of documents.
positive	Exceeded expectations. I've never owned a smart watch but having an iPhone, I knew i wanted the Apple watch. What made me lean to a series 2 is the submersible watch and gps. I haven't taken this thing off and the battery has lasted me 2 full days on one charge. Very good apps on the market for exercising. Has helped me keep my health on track. I have not tried swimming in it yet. I highly recommend. 
positive	Really fun designs, great options for personalizing fun grids with colors, text, grid choices.
positive	Old idea, with a new purpose.. adult relaxation! Once you start you can't stop till piece is finished!!
positive	Its a great apps. Very easy to create passport picture!
positive	Very satisfied. We've had our tv for about a month. Very happy with quality and picture. Haven't had any problems. 
positive	Happy purchase Great product, priced right, quite accurate readings, tested against another professional model.I use this to determine local swimming pools water temperature. 
positive	Very short wait. Staff was very nice. Visit with Dr. Magod was detailed and informative about the procedure. All in all it was a good experience. 
positive	I like it because it's relaxing, but sometimes the colours don't go into the spaces.
positive	Best app on Windows 10 Mobile. Easy setup and excellent to use. Works great!
positive	Simple and Effective. I use it a lot - never have any troubles so nothing to complain about. Love the boarding pass feature. 
positive	Excellent Washer. I am so pleased with my washer, it's quiet, and very efficient. It is very water conservative yet gets everything so clean, only draw back is the vibration. It shakes and shimmys and vibrates the whole apartment. It will reset itself but until it gets to a certain point it really shakes alot. But it's still awesome. I love how it works. I'm happy with my purchase. 
positive	Well designed. Doesn't do a ton but well designed I feel. 
positive	Pretty great. Although I've not tried other bible apps, this one suits my purposes well. It allows me to cross-reference verses using different versions without paying a cent or switching apps. It also includes footnotes like "some manuscripts read...." that provide slightly different ways of wording a verse in a single translation. The only negative things I've noticed is that your place on the page will sometimes change when rotating the screen, and that I rarely have to close and reopen the app to get it to load. 
positive	Five Stars These have superior sound, especially for the price. Great choice for every day headphones. 
positive	Summary. Read my stars thirty seven characters more or less 
positive	Five Stars My husband loved this game !! Glad I bought it for him !! 
positive	Thanks for adding the apod link, again. Last ask would be to let me zoom the image. Not enough to knock off a star for, though.
positive	I love this app! I do have premium so all of the documents I attach to assignments can be opened on my phone and tablet, which is definitely worth the money. I would recommend this for any student who is taking classes that require a lot of PDFs.
positive	Easy to use. This is my first time actually purchasing tickets through the app & it is easy and convenient! I love the fact that it allows you to purchase your seats via map! 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -I purchased this Amazon.com it arrived in two days, it looks to be stronger than the old one I had, which broke. This Oximeter will give me peace of mind, and probably satisfy my home care nurse.
positive	Ordered these for my 5yo son. They fit great for he foot, but the opening seems a little small. We manage to get his precious piggies in anyways and the shoes look awesome on him!
positive	Excelent products.. We all love our new tv the game station and the refrigerator, everything has been very usefull. 
positive	I like it, as it is easy to use. I hope to get some live streaming of different channels and TVs.
positive	Seems better. The app seems way better. It will even let me scroll through to a specific spot on a show without going through each commercial. Plus there are a minimum of commercials. Love the shows that are offered and the speed in which shows are posted after showing are wonderful. 
positive	great app,but please add Persian language👌thanks from developer.
positive	Rate: 5 stars -Ordered an unlock code for Samsung Samsung S7. Code was delivered in 12 hours and unlocked my device instantly.
positive	It's a phone card, people. How much of a product review do you need? SHEESH!!
positive	I went there today and while the building was beautiful it was quite boring. Everything was closed the museum, restaurant etc even though I checked opening times.It was also colder inside than outside so I couldn't stay long. Was good to just sit and reflect (and pray if you pray).
positive	Great upgrade to my Apple 4. I didn't know what I was missing by maintaining a 6-year old Apple 4, purchased in 2010. The size is larger, easier to read, many cool new features. The Best Buy associate transferred all of my Apps to the new phone. While this phone is a huge expense to my budget (including Tax, and cost for the case, glass cover and extra cord for my car), I will be happy if it lasts for 5 years and I'll certainly get my money's worth. Plus I received 5% Best Buy Rewards Points for the purchase. 
positive	Getting. Great improvement over the first series. Better battery life and the displays are bigger sndceasier to read 
positive	This product is great and does exactly what you want. Just a heads up, a 2x2 inch photo converts to 150 pixels x 150 pixels.
positive	Amazing TV. This TV is amazing. Fantastic picture and easy to use. Using the remote for putting in web addresses is not the easiest but I don't do it much so no worries there. I just down loaded the Samsung app for my phone and now its a breeze. Would not trade this TV for any other brand out there! 
positive	I love how I can sync all my passwords between my windows pc and my iphone! Well done and easy to use!
positive	Channel 9 has a lot of really great content, but their app has always left much to be desired. Normally I would just access content through the website, but this new app is great! I especially like the options to queue and download videos. My only suggestion for the developers is to add a dark theme. Great work though!
positive	Delivered on time. Instructions were easy to follow and treehouse was fairly simple to assemble. Our grandson who is 13 months old loves it. Very happy with our order!
positive	I had my baby on Similac from the day i brought her home untill she was 2 months old. She wasnt Pooping every day, she was so fussy and had a lot of gas. I changed her to the Enfamil Gentlease and its like i have a completely different child! She is so happy all the time does not fuss at all and she poops 2-3 times a day. So glad i switched!
positive	This app is Free! You may take a bit of time to figure out how it works, but it is just great. It gives you projections on the expenses and accounts you put in monthly. You can easily edit transactions, create categories, payees and more. It's wonderful!!
positive	Great doing business with Consumer Direct Mortgage. They were very helpful throughout the whole process. They guided us through all the necessary steps, were patient answering all questions, and very quick to respond to calls and emails. I would definitely do business with them again and highly recommend them to others.
positive	Rate: 5 stars -I love my trainers. They are very friendly. I feel amazing after every class that I attend. I attend 3/4 times a week. If I could, I would go every day.
positive	These wipes are wonderful! They are very soft but are also sturdy. Our favorite wipes by far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Your house is not clean. It's a dyson. It's amazing. Get your wife one, get your girlfriend one, get your mistress one, get yourself one, just don't get it as a birthday/Christmas/Valentine's Day/kwanza/etc gift for the ladies. Seriously, no don't do it... they'll be pissed even though they'll love the Dyson.Performance wise: This thing will suck up anything, even if you just cleaned with your old vaccum. Trust me your house is still dirty. Pet dander and dust in the form of a fine grey powder will quickly accumulate in the canister. Trust me, your house is still dirty. Cat hair, dog hair, dirt, pine needles from your Christmas tree that you left up too long and it dried out and made a mess ... none of it is too much for this bad boy to handle. Buy it and clean your house you dirty slob! 
positive	Love it 😊 This is the best app,just wish I could share more without paying. I have a website that I use this app on alot.
positive	I bought these for myself - I'm a women's 6.5 and ordered a size 5. They fit great, though a bit smaller than a woman's size 6 in terms of the length of the sole and width of the shaft. This worked well for me, though, as a I felt my women's boots were overwhelming me a bit with their size and weight. These are super cute- the glitter is subtle but fun.
positive	We like your hotel because of the location, our daughter lives in the Citron and we enjoy Ellsworth Mall
positive	Best app for me. It's really good app wonderful not internet no big size map and it show me things even in desertI life in Saudi Arabia and show me all names of thing. 
positive	I'm so thankful they had them in stock because the original Hunter website didn't. Ordered these for my little cousin for her birthday and they look fabulous and just like my pink hunter boots . Free 1 day shipping was awesome I love you Zappos !!!
positive	Tremendous picture. Best picture of any tv I've ever owned! Love the small remote 
positive	The person who needs to make the final review is my adult son who will be receiving the UGG Duffield throw on his birthday this month. It's the only thing he wants! Even though it is in the Women's Category, it was the color grey that was the deciding factor.
positive	Works great. Works great you can watch anything you want to do movie shows it's easy to hook up and easy to find . 
positive	Had a fantastic time Duncan Catherine and the cleaners were so nice. Nothing was to much trouble. They made our holidayspecial. The accomadation was spacious and very clean and was excellent value for the money. We will book with them again next year and each time we go . Thanks to the Meyer family for making us welcome you have got it spot on.Room Tip: All apartment s are lovely See more room tips
positive	Computer games and activities keep the mind strong to me I really enjoy dressing up or creating things.This is by far a great app.
positive	BEAUTIFUL! More of a periwinkle blue and I ordered a half size too large so have to return for correct sizing.
positive	Easy to use. really like it for some accounts that you do not use all the time.
positive	Five Stars They're perfect for winter jogs! 
positive	Awesome product with a "small" flaw!. I absolutely love Bose because their Bluetooth headphones are the best in the market. I have tried Jaybird, Beats, ODT Orcas and all of them do not compare to the battery life, comfort and sound quality most of all to the Bose SoundSport! The Bose application is nice but there is one "major" flaw. The ability to share music with another Bluetooth headset is NOT possible if it is not another Bose product. 🤦‍♂️ Please change that! Overall though, best product on the market as I use these every day for long periods of time. 
positive	This app is easy to use and have some nice features.
positive	Great Picture and Sound. Smart TV was easy to set up and functions well. I love how the TV makes switching from DVD to Internet to satellite so seamless. 
positive	I enjoy using this App. Main reason is the freedom. The fact that you are able to express or reflect your imagination, as if you were using paper to draw. Makes it fun and easy to use.
positive	Best watch I've ever purchased. Great for workout tracking and working ina field where having your cell phone isn't acceptable 
positive	Always had iPhones. They keep getting better. We've always had iPhones and needed to upgrade. Always improving them. 
positive	Five Stars Very nice set for the Dyson handheld vacuum. 
positive	Excellent in every way so far Excellent in every way so far. Easy to install with many installation options. Had my phone # ported and was done in 3-4 days. Using only the basic operation not the premier so can't comment on the added features. No dropped calls and clarity remains constant. This review written by my husband, (installer) 
positive	Nice watch with essential features I need.. Finally I purchased this watch after months of looking for smart watch beneficial to me. Good thing I did not only because it looks decent but also the features I need for my daily activities. I've been collecting watches and this is by far my favorite. I recommend this watch especially those who loves exercising. 
positive	I bought these because I was tired of sore toes and sore heels after a 7 mile hike in which I also do running sprints. After speaking with an REI running shoe specialist I bought these; They are amazing! There are also very slippery river rocks on the trails in which I sprint down hill & I don't slip anymore. My hamstrings thank these shoes as well lol.
positive	Love this App. I have been using this App for quite some time now - the more you use it, the more you realize it is way better than just a sketch pad! Quick and easy for when you just want to scribble a reminder when you are on-the-go! Also very handy for when you want to add photos and text for reference purposes to keep in a designated folder. 
positive	Stayed here in a 2 bedroom falconers suite and thoroughly enjoyed it. Modern décor, very clean and a true 5 star property. Service was excellent and staff are very attentive. Enjoyed the Alice in Wonderland afternoon tea also.
positive	Rate: 5 stars -I've been coming to ILoveKickboxing for about 2 months now and it was the BEST DECISION I've ever made to be a member. I've noticed significant increases in my overall fitness level and more importantly my happiness. This community is something special and all the instructors and other members make it a joy to come workout. Even at the end of a class I can't wait to hit the mats again!
positive	I absolutely love this application. If you enjoy editing photos. This is the app to use. The BEST!!!!
positive	I bought this coffee and it is smooth without being over powering...Love it
positive	Loving the new update. Runs beautifully and smoothly. Would like the ability to filter searches just like on the website
positive	Excellent for New Music. While it does not allow you to purchase in app (you can use your internet browser though), the app is fantastic for connecting the user to new bands' music as well as their merch. Highly recommend 
positive	Best product on amazon hands down If u unlock its full potential it's tv heaven!! 
positive	Great App.. This application could not have been more simple and easy to setup and use. Allowed us to bypass a very long line and go thru customs/immigration in about 2 minutes. Great job by Homeland Security to make travel easier. 
positive	Wow... What an app... Dlna support.. It makes windows phone complete for me... The best youtube client... I think its far advanced in terms of look n feel and functionality... All the best guys... U did a marvelous job... Keep it up... Cheers
positive	This old cathedral is very large and the windows and statues are amazing. Well worth a visit. It takes at least 30 minutes to look round properly and to take in all the fantastic architecture.
positive	Love these. Wear them mostly barefoot, as high end slippers I can walk outside with in a pinch. Like Birkenstock's for the Winter! I'd also recommend: Birkenstock
positive	you guys are the greatest.tks for sharing this experience with me.
positive	It's very helpful for what I need it for, easy to use and it saves my notes until I delete it. I love it. I use it every week for my bible study groups prayer request, and I save them so I can go back and check which one has been answered. I count it a blessing!
positive	Great place to go and everyone is polite and very caring to your needs and comfort. I won't go to anybody else!!! 
positive	Love it!. I had another type app and used it and paid. When trying to find something better I tried iHeart Radio and the free version was better than the other I was paying for. I listen to it more than the local stations. Pick my genre or era of music and enjoy! 
positive	Great vacuum, terrible manual There is nothing not to like about this vacuum. The battery lasts long enough to clean my 1200-sq. foot apartment (mostly carpeted), and with very little effort. The engineering is top-notch. I look forward to cleaning days, and that's saying a lot.But the learning curve is steep because the manual is written (I use the word loosely) for pre-literate kindergarteners. It consists entirely of enigmatic pictures. The vacuum comes with 6 attachments, 3 of which are unfamiliar to me. OK, they reveal what the bare-floor attachment is good for, but there is also a miniature brush attachment (upholstery? tight spots?) and a curious tool with a sliding sheath. I think it's for use as a hand vac, but can't be sure because the included comic strip reveals nothing about it.If the makers of a $600 vacuum find they cannot afford to include a detailed manual, maybe they could post something online? 
positive	I love the features and I wish they would add some more in. thanks
positive	Excellent product for any level of experience.. This was my 15 year old son's first DSLR. He was able to capture some amazing shots. The photos had depth and very good clarity. 
positive	Gotta Love Them. These guys deserve five stars, IMO, because they busted down the door, and forced the big bloated fat cats to compete. I quit the big DTV a year ago, because my bill was $120 a month and going up, and there were still nights we couldn't find anything that appealed to us. For about eight months we just watched with antenna, as well as Amzn streaming. Last Summer Sling shows up with their service and a cheap Apple TV for $20 a month. Signed up immediately. The service was spotty at best, but the idea is great. Fast forward to December, DTVNow shows up with more channels and an even better Apple TV offer. Well, of course I jumped on it. The point of this review is that Sling TV really did something for the people. If you read this far I thank you. 
positive	Was working fine, but.... I've had this app for a while now and I loved it. Worked great and I enjoyed using it. However, a few weeks have gone by and only a few random songs that I search will play. I can't play or DL any songs. Also the Dropbox won't let me log in to try and still get songs on there. It is very frustrating and disappointing. 
positive	I enjoy having the choice of listening to a variety of music depending on my mood and the time of day.
positive	Everything was reasonably good except 1) local area was very congested, 2) valet parking/charge was almost a necessity for disabled guests, and 3) room heating unit was very noisy making sleep very difficult.
positive	Craig Koren from J.G. Wentworth was an excellent loan officer. He was able to get me the best interest rate out there after shopping around with 3 or 4 other companies. He was in constant communication back and forth during the mortgage process. I never waited any more than 30 minutes for a reply for any question I had, including off hours such as nighttime. He was hi ghly informed about the process and explained every detail in a common sense manner so that an every day layperson could understand. He was friendly and professional and I would highly recommend him to any friends/relatives out there looking for a mortgage ... Read More
positive	It's an Evo, why are you even still reading this?. Seriously though. Top notch read and write speeds, cool looks, amazing warranty, what else do you need in an SSD? 
positive	I feel real scientific Not really, I just bought this to get the temperature of water for brewing tea. But if it's good enough for Gale Boetticher it's good enough for me 
positive	Super cool space photos. Something far out everyday. Serious eye candy.
positive	Perfect!. Modern, perfect, easy to set up. I've used Samsung brand for all my TVs and have never been dissapointed. 
positive	Simply enjoy the fundamentals of coloring and the relaxation of it all. My particular pics of choice are flowers and owls. Takes your mind of the junk.
positive	My daughter is 4 foot tall and I was worried the boot was gonna go to the knee but sits below the knee looks great and she loves rhem
positive	I love these slippers . Although the size chart suggested I would wear a 41, I know that normally I wear a 42. Sure enough, although the 41 fit, I felt the 42 was better for wearing with socks . I really like the arch support in these slippers . I wear orthotic supports in my shoes , so it's nice to have a slipper that comes close to feeling like I'm wearing my supports. I also like how the slippers easily stays on my foot and are so comfortable.
positive	I highly recommend this product. I used it with my first child 5 and a half years ago after the first two weeks of her life she was absolutely miserable with gas. Within one day she had large improvement, with in a few days it was like she was a different baby and was super happy, slept way better,and no longer crying all the time. I knew with my second child I recently gave birth to I would give her this same formula. She is a happy baby with minimal gastro issues. The only down fall I would have to say about this formula is not the formula itself but the small canister you can purchase. I have had a couple incidents when I put them in the diaper bag the lid would pop off in transit then I had to throw the whole container away incase contamination occured. I love the larger tubs design especially with the little hook that holds the scooper to it. I wish the click lids and the scooper hook on the inner lid of the large tubs could be incorporated in the smaller containers.
positive	Five Stars Perfect iPhone 7 Case! very elegant. 
positive	I like everything about it I like everything about it. It is a little heavier than I should be carrying but that is the price for all the features 
positive	great keyboard. Great keyboard, exactly what I was looking for and at a great price 
positive	I can make playlists for each mood. Its so much better than Sirius or Pandora, and much cheaper than buying all these songs!
positive	Very happy! I love it. Easy to set up, easy to use and very good sound quality. 
positive	Great Tv. This was an absolute steal and one of the best quality tvs I've ever bought 
positive	Great camera at a great price! The kit is great and I'm a beginner. Stylish, fun, and easy to use with practice. 
positive	The pictures are gorgeous and creative. For free, this app is worth it.
positive	Best Buy Ever. I bought a Vizio 55in had it for week returned it and upgraded to the Samsung. This television supersedes that Vizio 1000%, Best Buy Ever. 
positive	Staff was wonderful! Very helpful, great personalities, seems like they enjoy their jobs and love serving their customers!
positive	Love it. I honestly really love WattPad. Right now I'm not gonna be the person who goes on and on about how great it is. Im just gonna say that I love reading books that I can get really into. It's hard to find those books sometimes, but WattPad is there. There are so many different writers and writing styles, it hard to get enough. There are so many genres, so it will probably have what you want I'm a fan fic kind of girl (random person: Seriously 😒Me: Don't hate on me. We all have our guilty pleasures. Some more than others 😏)WattPad has all of my fan-fics. I love it. Thanks for reading!😘 
positive	Love this app. Easy to use, keeps all my projects and their required tasks easy to see, track, and reassign for effectiveness. Great Productivity Tool
positive	Go with marina Account has lots of good snorlax and drags. Perfect for gyms. Also great Lapras count as well. Will update if it gets banned 
positive	Comfortable location near Washington DC and only a block from the metro station. Highly recommend it!
positive	Great all around phone. The videos taken with this have been great. It's easy to use with great results. I like the wide selfie view. Other online videos are very good. The screen is amazing. So far I've dropped it once, and it passed the drop test...still works without issue. 
positive	Great power supply. Great power supply with cable modules just hooked up what I need to keep the case look nice and clean 
positive	These are my second pair. First pair lasted 3 years. Will still use them for outside. Very warm with good padding
positive	Awesome sound. The power beats were great, they had a clear and good sound with the music. I like the fact that I can use it with my iPhone. 
positive	Tracking by categories and payee works great. It would be great if it could link to online back accounts. It requires manual entries for all transactions but once that manual part is done, display is great. I also like that you can pull data into excel for further analysis.
positive	Very reliable Very reliable!! I previously used a Net-Talk unit, but it kept dropping calls and gave a dial tone when it wasn't connected to the server (red light on). Since I wanted a unit to wire-in as a second line, not all of the phones are near the unit and it was annoying to try to make a call, get a dial tone and have it not connect. No such problem with the Ooma - if there is an internet issue, it not only turns red, but the dial tone stops. Since installing the Ooma, the connections have been very reliable. We are using an Ooma supplied number and paying the taxes every few months - so do not have Caller-Id and some of the other premium services. 
positive	It was fine! Not spectacular, but it was okay.
positive	Unlike any other slipper I've owned in the past. These slippers have the comfort and support I associate with shoes . The sole is tough, but flexible. I love the simplicity of the style also. Absolutely the best slippers I've ever owned and I've owned many good pairs of slippers . Bonus: My son helped me pick them out as a gift, which I'm sure he'll see me enjoy for many, many years.
positive	SO MANY PRIZES!👏🏼👏🏼😋💕. I downloaded this app after seeing it on Instagram and it is great! U can spin the wheel so many times and get the opportunity to win such cool prizes!! I haven't won yet because I haven't had the game too long, but I enjoy trying!! I really want the $200 Sephora gift card SOOOO BAD! I use ALL my points on it!!!😩😩😍 ((My insta name is @_mand _)) 
positive	Works great. Works great with Xbox one. Very easy to use and set up! 
positive	Great diapers for babies/toddlers on the move. Keep baby dry and comfy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	So amazing...especially how you can merge videos and add songs for the background
positive	Works perfect! It works really really well. Recommended it to my daughter. 
positive	Lm. Why is online payment removed in latest update?!!! 
positive	Good Podiatrist. Fixed my son's ingrown toenail issues permanently. 
positive	Greatest Guitar App. I've been playing guitar for over 40 years. Just decided to commit myself to reinvigorating my playing after a 10 year hiatus and saw this app. It's great for new or experienced players. Musicians need stimulation that differs based on where we wish to focus our energies & this app allows you to help the guitar community by writing parts to popular songs in all genres one day. You can then learn songs for new projects rapidly since most guitarists will see opportunities filling in for existing bands who need fill ins routinely. It also contains tools i.e. Tuners to help as well. You can actually see what effect pedal set ups where used for many of the songs. My newest discovery was the new infusion of backing tracks that were recently added. I could go on further but simply put you can't beat it for the price. 
positive	I really like this surge protector. If you use a MacBook with the large AC adapter, it does not sit well on a typical power strip. This product gives a nice wide area to support the AC adapter. I also have an Asus laptop with a similar style power connector. I use this surge protector for both laptops and separate dual monitors. I feel this is really important because if the AC adapter is not sitting correctly in the socket, over time it will start to arc and could potentially be a fire hazard (worst case, if you never notice arcing buildup on the connector) But as much as AC adapters cost, anything to prolong the life of the adapter is a good investment. The large on/off button is also really nice to use. It's backlit and has a positive feel to it, without being clunky. Great value, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one (bought two when I made this purchase) 
positive	Great app for customizing and shopping for new avatar parts. It's also a great time waster. Overall, it's a well designed and fun app.
positive	Great Item. I have been using western digital products. Always reliable. Easy to use 
positive	I bought the Cruisers for the first time recently since my daughter is constantly on the go. I was a little worried at first because they seemed thinner than the other Pampers diapers, but so far so good! They fit great for my very mobile 1yr old and she stays dry! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Easy set up. Solid and simple to install. Great value for the cost 
positive	Update everywhere and instore preview images! So people can know its a new app!
positive	This app makes it easy to give my photo a little extra dimension.
positive	Were the restrooms clean at this provider's office? Absolutely Did your provider ask enough questions that you felt they took a holistic approach to your appointment? I was impressed. From the soothing music to the time they spent with me. I definitely knew they took a holistic approach to their service. Is this provider easy to reach in an emergency? Absolutely Are you going to visit this provider again? Absolutely Was this provider's staff friendly? Yes 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -Super simple and easy! Attractive looking website too. Highly recommend using it if you need to unlock your cellphone!
positive	great free and gives god recommendations i feel like everytime i listin its a song i love and you can skip a song but you do get a limit but not forever just for the day so in my mind best free music app on xbox
positive	Great Communication, responsive and knowledgeable bankers!
positive	This hotel works great if you are having a short stay in London. Easy to get to Heathrow and central London. Would work nicely for a family and would allow you to have some meals in using the apartment kitchen
positive	softer then any other and they last longer.Well worth every penny.
positive	Great add on. Great product, fast and responsive. Might be better than roku 
positive	Five Stars replaced the original game we had that broke 
negative	A bad experience went there on friday 3rd feb waited for 2hrs for our food. When we asked for our bill to pay for drinks consumed we were told "they are very busy". Tried to call the supervisor who ignored us only came when we stood to walk out in frustration we had not eaten and she said we can leave, no apologies offered. Worst of all it was a birthday dinner
negative	This is bs! I don't like it at all this isn't gif making!
negative	When I upload pictures with a text then it doesn't show the picture for me... also change back to the old look 
negative	One Star Way too difficult even for very well-versed Star Wars fans 
negative	Just bad, its like a eight year old was trying to type with Microsoft Word but did not even try to edit grammar. Then the app says add your location of the photo... That is not finding the location of the photo. This app is also using the Windows 8.1 Metro UI with ads from Walmart. Just bad
negative	Cash me outside how bout dat this game is terrible 
negative	I GIVE GREAT REVIEWS ABOUT HOW NICELY IT DOWNLOADED. AND IT WAS ALSO VERY GOOD AT UPLOADING A PHOTO I WANTED EDITED. AS FOR THE ACTUAL EDITING.... IT DISMISSES ITSELF FROM DOING ANY OF THAT. HMMM, MAYBE IT DOESN'T LIKE THE PICTURE I CHOSE. YA THINK? NOT!
negative	Right out of the box and it doesn't work. Literally received this less than 24 hours ago and i plug it into my brand new xbox one. Makes a bunch of whirring noises and boom, no more power light. Plug it into my macbook and little whirring noises and it dies. This is an abysmal product and super pissed that it doesn't work straight out of the box. 
negative	I got this as a backup drive. Within two ... I got this as a backup drive. Within two days the drive died so completely that DiskUtility couldn't even repair it. So disappointing. 
negative	Died after 9 months. I purchased this in June 2016 and it died on February of 2017. Very disappointed. 
negative	I've used this religiously since my daughter was a few days old. So in the last 9 months if had no problems with it until this last week. After the slew of daily updates, the app constantly freezes and has to be restarted. I'll also click stop on a breastfeeding session, it'll stop then resume itself about 5 seconds later. It doesn't do it every time but it's often enough to mess up my times and irritate me. Please fix, I'd had this at 5 stars previously. 
negative	Subpar Simon--avoid! Though we were thrilled (my 10-year-old, especially) to receive this Simon, we've had trouble since the start. Particularly, this is a licensed Simon, but not made by the original Simon makers. They've tried to improve upon the old standard, and they have failed. The new "touch technology" just doesn't work, and we've been so disappointed. Instead of actually pushing down a button, you simply touch the color and a sensor identifies your selection. Particularly, our green sensor fails over and over again--even with new batteries and a manual reset. We called the main Simon help line, and they said, "Oh, we don't make that one, you'll have to call another company." OK. We called the other company and left a message about our problems, but never heard anything back. And, now, the window to return has passed. Do NOT buy this product. Go for the original Simon at all costs. 
negative	Too much VIDEO adds that can't even be stopped like in other apps. 
negative	I was happy with it apart from the shocks I am in the process of returning this, Electric shocks when using, constantly!I read a review on this Vacuum before I bought it saying it will shock you, thought it was just a faulty one. Not the case.I was happy with it apart from the shocks. I will by a different model. 
negative	Broken! App won't run on 'rooted' device. :
negative	Ordered four things and none of them arrived way after the Buyer Protection ran out. Messaged all four of the buyers and no one responded. Opened dispute and still no response. These buyers are just trying to cheat you of your money, don't fall for it. 
negative	More spam than real men. The real men either dont chat or its a dead end. If it actually had people on there, it might be cute and work. Maybe cut the price until this site gains momentum 
negative	Resets every few minutes after last update. Used to love this app. Huawei p8 lite 
negative	It sucks why is it in spanish they should delete it from the app store and everyone should delete it and it's so bad i had it for 5 seconds and deleted it so please don't waste time and don't get it if you do delete it 
negative	2017 season update is useless!! Too crowded and too slow to even bother with! If you want news or videos from the AFL I suggest using their website, this app will just drive you mad. 
negative	bon t play on it but it just go around in circles and little hill and ice but even if you jump on them you have to retard the game BON T PLAY ON IT PEC OF GAR but sorry for my whiteing 
negative	Previous version scored 5/5 latest version version is an epic failure, completely unusable on a Samsung Tab 3 and an S5, scrap it and upload previous version before you loose your reputation and customers 
negative	Broken sound after a month. The headset is busted after after a month of regular used.100% static sound when listening to music on my iPhone, changed to different headset, static sound gone.Not expecting this happened for a headset at this price range. 
negative	Absolutely a rip off I have been rinsed of over £300 in 24 hours as soon as you bet the highest amount in my case after building up 100 million it took the lot every time in less than 2 minutes 
negative	You are right five days already passed I still didn't receive even a single gem or coin or what is in the list 
negative	Played this game for a year but you do not receive the same amount you put into it. Scopely doesn't care about people, cheating is rampant, exploiting also, Scopely doesn't care as long as it doesn't effect their bottom line. Tournaments are impossible to place high in bc money not strategy reigns. Look for another game!! Do not be fooled. The game's dying anyway bc of Scopelys repeated and blatant money grubbing. And now the survival road tournament they just rolled out is completely pay to pay. Trust a veteran of this game, there are better games out there with much better developers who actually give a crap about their product and customers! 
negative	There's no customers to purchase my gig ! 😠😠😤😤 
negative	One Star Ordered in November and just recently checked. Nothing has backup. Don't buy! Missed return day by 3 days. 
negative	One Star Keeps locking itself and you cannot delete or use files anymore 
negative	I can't even play please make so that you can play with mobile decides it looks amazing but it just goes all static :
negative	First i gave it 5 stars til i figured out you have to pay to win. It's like crack you always wait for that first rush but never get it. Customer service sucks. If you complain on their Facebook site they ban you. Good time killer but a piece of crap also. 
negative	The game isn't at all interested it'd just jumping bricks and the music in the background...not happy 
negative	But it is impossible to use if you do not rate it....enough with the request already. Could you add a do not show me this again box?
negative	App is worthless.. I can't connect to major banks like Ally or US Bank. Some accounts don't show up right. Claims that I have Netflix and audible subscriptions, even though I don't and never have. Support doesn't help you as they are in the wrong time zone. Just stick with Mint. 
negative	Couldn't even play, keeps saying I xmodgames installed and I deleted that a year ago. Something is wrong with it 
negative	This game is a scam !!! Do not download other apps for free chips, you will never receive the chips. Never giving any game by joytap a chance again. 
negative	KEEPS CRASHING, CAN'T DELETE UN WANTED SONGS. UPDATE!!!! As OF RIGHT NOW APP SUCKS! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!! 
negative	Installed new update and played for few hours and lost all my data... was at level 22 turned game off for few hours and found i started all over at level 1.... not happy. .. had 12- 15 players with one gold member. ... Please help 
negative	Why neople.... Thought you learned that nexon isn't to be trusted. This game is garbage. Three most horrible controls I've ever seen. Holding my phone like that is very uncomfortable and the controls just do not work, press forward... It goes left... Press left... It goes right... Press right... It zig zags forward. It just doesn't work. And the tutorial.... You can't pay for 5 seconds straight without the stupid tutorial stopping you which can easily get you killed over and over again. And knowing horrible nexon the cash shop is disgustingly over priced and unfair. Neople.... Nexon is not to be trusted, you learned this from dfo. Why.... Sigh 
negative	Why does this keep updating itself into my phone?!?! I DON'T EVEN HAVE A FACEBOOK!!! 
negative	Yet another app that doesn't work, and this time one by Microsoft themselves! It is a travesty that they are even thinking about bringing out a Surface Phone when they can't get the existing phone software to work properly.
negative	Update destroyed my progress Thanks a lot for the stupid update for the tutorial. Came in game and saw my progress gone after update. Only the tutorial telling me how to play the game again. Thanks a lot smart asses 
negative	One Star Not good came in broken. Have no return number to call back. 
negative	This is a horrible game I thought it was awesome but it's dumb and stupid it's the same as juju on the beat and damn Daniel .. if the company wants to win more money with ads then make better game. Duh. Right you agree then like 
negative	Not good. Not good. This is just a toy, not a real guitar. Even after restringing and tune up, it still sounds terrible (they just go right back to out of tune). 
negative	This shoes are comfortable but you cannot wear for a day.. They are not breathable and make your feet very sweaty... Not recommended
negative	Doesn't do what it says on the package Not as accurate as they say Needs to use Internet data or wifi to locate people on the network GPS doesn't seem to locate anything what so ever unless 'Oh yes you have Internet on all the time Not worth the money paid out 
negative	Update. Pictures do not load, watchlist saves lots but the next time you log in they won't show. Sometimes watched vehicles on twice . Auctions do not load on iPhones , they show error message. It's honestly a disappointment 
negative	This is bogus. I PURCHASED another ultimate guitar app and had to upgrade to this one since it was no longer supported. Now I have to pay a monthly subscription. What a ripoff. Perhaps ultimate guitar could credit my google account back THANKS 
negative	Our room was facing the park that is quite nice itself. However the room was a disaster. Gloomy, cold, old duvets, carpets, closets... everything is long long out of date and should be replaced ages ago. I am surprised people still go to hotels like that as I cannot find a single positive point to mention. Breakfast was served in nearby Histrion hotel. First impression is really something. Notices on all tables how you should not take away any food?! Take your pardon? Please serve food that cannot be taken away... or that should be at least tasty. Grilled vegetables were namely cold, choice is poor, staff not pleasant. Pool complex in Histrion hotel ia also dated but so poorly cleaned that it wont see me again. Too high prices for what you get. I'd keep away. New management needed urgently!!!
negative	Bad quality items with the subscribe option Somehow the quality of the pampers in the subscribe and save option is extremely bad. The diaper rips within 1-2 hours of use and there is a leak every time. The same item bought in local T
negative	One Star Maybe mine is broke, but she doesn't do anything I ask her to do. 
negative	Bush league app that basically circulates the same few content pages... 
negative	Zoom allows this product to be used by peadophiles Zoom along with Google + are allowing possible the world largest paedophile network to be operated via the Zoom meeting room's platforms along with Google + by the way of allowing communities to advertise Zoom meeting room numbers. that such despicable crimes against children are committed either by broadcasting media or actually taking place live ,this takes place in a vast amount of Zoom PnP meeting room's and Nobody seems to be doing anything about this ,not Zoom Google nor the Police.. 
negative	The app has crashed multiple times, which, even with the safe mode plus active, sent my toddler to the phones main screen. I was then handed the phone with tesco direct on the screen, with a denovo wifi extender in the shopping basket, asking for my card details. DO NOT GIVE TO CHILDREN 
negative	I hated it because you cant die and it is stooped and why do thy have tnt if we cant it it and this game is NOT one of those fun games IT IS S STOOPED DONT DANLOD 😲 
negative	On first play, the user interface went blank and caused my whole phone to freeze up for a while. On second play, after I fully closed the app, it still took up a double space in my notifications, and refused to let me swipe it left. I listened to two talk radio stations. Both are literally 7 min of ads followed by 7 min of program (including lead in music and other stuffing). They had to edit down the shows for this format, and seem to have cut out most of the substance in favor of the foolery. The ad-supported version of this app is a poor venue for talk radio. 
negative	This was a waste Unfortunately closed app error Every time 
negative	One Star its a piece of crap!!! it went out 5 months after i got it!!!! 
negative	Sun Life needs the customers to submit documents by mail or fax only. They have claimed that their new App can do it, but I have confirmed that their App actually cannot yet as of 2017. When I did send the original documents by mail, they just claimed that they never got it. They are very frustrating to deal with, especially since my previous employer had another large provider that had used a website to submit all claims with any documents. Sun Life on the other hand cannot accept any documents electronically, demands originals be mailed, and simply loses any mailed-in copies, resulting in denied claims by default since I cannot submit original documents.
negative	When selecting photos in chat the app fails to load freezes than crashes. Also draining battery at a super high rate. 
negative	I dont know why Iam giving 1 star to this app 
negative	After 10 years of regular use at our church, we wanted to replace our old Ultimate stackable mic stands so we went looking for the current version of what we had. Of the 8 we bought a year ago, one was bad (wouldn't hold height adjustmentslid straight to the bottom) out of the box. In the course of the year, I think there's one left that holds position. At first, the little collar at the top of the lower portion could be tightened to get them to work, but that no longer works. A real disappointment! 
negative	Rate: 1 stars -Poor quality!! Horrible return policy!! Bad customer service!! Only gave me $25 back from $143 purchase!
negative	Crashes. The browser doesn't work and you get an error message when you try to click on a link. Also, it doesn't have a back button so if you want to leave a page you have to re-search it.The app itself is slow. Surveys take forever to load and don't allow for horizontal screen orientation. Hope it will be fixed soon since I love Swagbucks and use it multiple times a day. 
negative	There needs to be preferences to add like on omegle I just wanted to use this to meet other beatboxers but cant 😑 
negative	Keep away Cheap junk. This guitar won't hold tune. One string broke when attempting to tune it the first time. Returned it. I do not recommend this guitar. 
negative	Blatant bait and switches. People offer gigs at 5, fiverr charges u a 1 dollar fee, then the person raises the price and cancels when you object. Then fiverr keeps the 1 dollar fee 
negative	Sale madari kera pare tere upar.... Sala fraud Jhut bolta hai... Taira biwi dusra ke sath bhag jai 
negative	worked like a charm Could not get this device to work on two of my computers. XP and 10. Son who is more computer savvy couldn't get it to work.Bought another brand, worked like a charm. 
negative	buy WD instead didn't last a year before it died. I buy WD drives now instead of shitgates. 
negative	You killed the game with the huge Hands of Midas nerf. It was fun while it lasted, time to move on to another game I guess. 
negative	Crash It always crashes and whenever I open it again it resets my progress. 
negative	Anytime I play online and I lag out before the match begins I lose the money I put on the game . needs fixing please ASAP 
negative	Te this game do not download this game😢 very bad 
negative	it was a mandatory app when i got the phone. Its overcomplicated and deletes any playlists i make from music saved on my sd card. also it copies every song 2X. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND, I WANT THE DEFAULT PLAY MUSIC APP 
negative	It detects that my AIO Gestures app is a hacking app. Well I think it isn't. PLEASE FIX. I HAVEN'T STARTED TO PLAY. I will uninstall for the meantime. 
negative	Very good app for keeping track of where your money goes. It's so easy to use!
negative	Can you stop releasing new legend heroes per month? Raising power to one hero just became so hard for late game with many tasks you put just to raise 1 hero , and you keep releasing new legends per month. Good way to search for money! 
negative	I played this game 4 a yr. Phone crashed n then google nor the creators of the game could get me bqck to the level I was playing. I was almost an A star. So disappointed 😔😔😔😔 
negative	They are only 3 characters. And it needs some improvements. 
negative	I'd say it's a biased game. Like people at summoner level 2 get good 4 star players. I'm at summoner level 38 and I don't even have good 4 star players. People at summoner level 20 even have four 4 star players. Moreover, every time I open a premium hero crystal, I get a 2 star player. I've seen so many guys getting 4 star players but for me I guess the premium hero crystal is a 2 star hero crystal. It sucks. 
negative	I hated this game so bad...its the worst game ever...tottaly big rip off of clash royal...it suks do not download this game 
negative	Do not buy Cannot stay connected to internet. Need to unplug TV for 30 seconds for it to reset and then it will connect to the internet. I do not have issues with any other smart TV or wireless device in my house. Samsung said it was an issue with my internet provider, but the DVD player that sits directly under the TV doesn't lose the internet connect and gets Netflix just fine. Very frustrated with Samsung support, no help at all. 
negative	out of my 3 oreds which I hd placed, I hv nt received this item...nivea lip butter blueberry blush, purplle doesn't even bother 2 revert 2 my mail, it doesn't seem purplle team is likely going 2 deliver my order nymore so guys b careful while placing n order. 1 stars out of 5
negative	One Star Reception is bad and the receiver cannot hear clearly the conversation at all. 
negative	Never stayin here again. This was the worst experience checking into a hotel ever! They tried to charge my card 5 times in a span of 3 days! Twice the day before check in, once the morning of and I wasn't even checking in yet, once again at night when I was already checked in and asleep. And the final time after I checked out and signed for everything. And all the charges were not the amount of what cost me to stay in the room! The hotel apologized and told me it wouldn't happen again and guess what it did after I checked out. This place is unprofessional and they can't communicate within their own coworkers. Like I said before never staying here again!!!
negative	What a joke!!! If I get one more 'oops sorry..an error occurred' I think I'll go out of my mind!! On-line check-in SHOULD be a straightforward procedure...what a tin-pot set-up. 
negative	Major issues with controls...can't move tank and turret at same time,if I'm moving and I try to move turret tank stops and freezes,also game doesn't register damage done even though I critically hit, also enemy tanks disappear from screen even if there right next to me, I love this game but it is critically flawed 
negative	This version is rubbish the previous version was way easier to use, please bring back the previous version 
negative	Karen is a confused type of sorts.She really doesn't think before she speaks on various subject matters.Maybe some self psycho therapy would help. 
negative	This game is glitchy and its BULLSHIT take out that u lose rating I don't like the game with it cuz this game took like 100 rating from me 
negative	This is not perfume, it is toilette. It doesn't even come close to the quality it is advertised to be. Sam's Club deleted my first review about this issue.
negative	Disfunctional - steals all my data on a daily basis 
negative	Bad update. I updated the app and it deleted my upcoming schedules. Not cool 
negative	like how there are even the new movies that are not out yet i wish the movies that are not out yet were in sd at least
negative	The game is seriously insane about spending money.. any time you complete a mission they have an offer. If decline they take it step further and ask are you sure. Only 1 sniper rifle you can buy with normal currency.. the other 39 sniper rifles you gotta spend money to get. That goes for all the guns.. one last thing tons and I mean a TON of ads. Every mission you complete you get an ad. Some times two ads because you know why not 
negative	Inaccurate, often fails to locate unless on wifi at home, then randomly notifies hours later. a long distance has to be travelled before it even tracks this needs to be shortened & location area needs to be tightened it shows I'm at home even though I'm 50m away in a shop. I know understand its a battery saving feature but its inaccuracy is defeats the purpose 
negative	Not what was pictured I did not receive what was pictured. The cube was wrapped in plastic (not factory sealed but like someone's personal machine) inside a plain box. No brand box or stand as shown in pictures. It did have a hasbro sticker but not sure if real since nothing else was included. 
negative	Do not buy No help fron WD cannot get my computer to recognize HD. Emailed WD for support they all must be at political rallies...no response. 
negative	I thought it was just like the picture I hated it 
negative	Used to be fun till GREE bought it. Used to be fun before what's her face got all cozy with the devs and started manipulating things. Now it's a dark and sinister place with a seedy malevolent underbelly. 
negative	This last update has made me think its not worth persisting with the app. Don't understand why you think this is an improvement. Read the posts and learn how not to make changes that cause users angst!!! 
negative	Well the obvious hackers and way to much money to get a upgrade for it let you race way higher Cass bikes but, when you use that same bike it's locked =% 
negative	Worst product ever! Leaves little to be desired smears all over the screen. Tried with brand new microfiber cloth to see if it was grease on the cloth, well its not! Stay away from this product. 
negative	I got this now because I bought an Xbox bluetooth controller and it says it has controller support. Well, this Xbox controller works with every game i own that has the ability to use a controller. Even older games like Namco's soul calibur or even sonic the hedgehog. Also works with riptide GP renegade, rockstars Bully and an assortment of many of different kind of games. My Bluetooth controller does nothing in this game so sadly I won't even be giving it a test run. 
negative	To many ads, when you finish a level and in between levels 
negative	Starting a boycott on this game. Do not spend any money they dont fix problems in game and when u lose something like an egg they dont give it back i strongly suggest u dont spend money i have gotten a bunch to stop maybe they will listen if we all stop!!!! 
negative	Rate: 1 stars -I didnt take minute to do some research about this website and i just wanted code for my galaxy S6 as this was for my mother so this website popped up and i went for it stupid me. It asked 19.99 i went for it ordered my code with out ready reviews... ive got robbed this website is a scammer dont use it ur gonna get stupid code that doesnt work and everytime i call the number wont work just tells u their closed ive never received my code im gonna go to the bank o5peb claim....but ive got my code from ebay for 12.00$ and it worked for me first time ive tried... THIS WEBSITE WILL TAKE UR MONEY AND GIVE U NOTHING
negative	I can watch nothing it does let me see the episodes or play the episodes please fix
negative	App recently stopped saving downloads. I watch the download occur and conclude, but the download dies not hold. When I go back to listen, the podcast has not been downloaded. This issue is something new, never had this until recently.
negative	Its an app created by the government agency, why does it need ads?? It doesn't allow card to be downloaded as most of the time, server error message pop-up, why??This is not an app, but just a wrapper for the website. It sucks 
negative	I played the free version on my tablet for a couple weeks then decided to get the paid version because the game was fun but it didn't let me transfer the data from the free version to the paid one, I tried with both paid versions but neither of them worked. 
negative	Game is unusable, smoke and flames are horrible. Game gets so slow it stops responding on tab 12.2 pro. 
negative	JEEZ!!! with the ads! Big Lots is the Big Loser with this app. A popup ad every third and fourth click? Are you joking? 
negative	Pehle toh yeh app bhut achha tha but ab yeh bhut bakwaas ho gaya hai bhut slow hai 
negative	I played it for a short amount of time but it just kept crashing plz fix 
negative	Not so great and not that easy to use. Better to use basic crop
negative	Poor amount of free coins. Gone in 5 minutes! Unexciting! 
negative	This game is great, i love it! But there a huge problem that needs to be adressed. I try to play 1v1 but it will only search once and a while, most of the time it tells me my network isnt stable, no matter if i use wifi or data. Will definitely rate higher and recommend if this is fixed! P.S. when i get into a game tho it awesome i love it! 
negative	Defective Merchandise Screen is scratched, triangle that shows when you score a small straight doesn't show up, the first zero of your score shows two ones because the top and bottom line of the zero don't show. SO embarrassed since this was given as a gift. Birthday boy says he will "make do" with it but I'm SO disappointed!!!! 
negative	Unable to add BANK OF BARODA acc to this upi app.. this is of no use 
negative	Had issues a month ago, submitted a ticket and had no reply, sent 2 emails and still no reply, 2 weeks of diamonds missing, game crashes resetting progress multiple times. Customer service to this day is non existent. 
negative	Stupid valentines update. Nonsense to play anymore. Uninstalling. 
negative	Horrible after recent update. WAS a good app. Recent update now has ads appear (that you have to X out of and pray don't take you to the App Store) roughly every 30 seconds. Sometimes two at a time. Oh, and every time you go to a new page/screen.It is now easier and less frustrating to just visit the Gay Cities website via safari. They completely ruined this app and I will no longer be using it. Don't waste your time. 
negative	I hate it it said prove,you're not a robot then takes forever to upload the f***ing images so sort it out now 
negative	Fraud don't download this plz don't waste your data 
negative	I have this app on my Android phone (and LOVE it) and have recently downloaded it from the Windows Store to my computer (and HATE it). I logged into my account (that I initially created from my phone) and have come to find out that none of my favorite radio stations play. The iHeartRadio Windows Store App simply does not work! I waited over 30 minutes for something to play but nothing ever did. What a complete waste of time. Don't bother wasting yours. Delete, delete, delete!
negative	Starts off great, and within 2 minutes it goes into hyper load and freezes or shuts down.
negative	Dont waist your time after 3 months none of my orders showed up. Not one item thats pretty sad really. Customer support sucks only machines reply. Also i was refunded for my orders with out even knowing about it. How about resending the stuff i wanted rather then giving me my money back 
negative	Hello my name is Sky i got a problem about in the game i dont know is it a bug or something. The problem is "i cant talk in the game" is this a bug or something becuse i try to talk in the game but it dont work pls help. 
negative	They are so thin , I thought they were one ply napkins
negative	Haven't even been able to get the game to load. Crashes every single time I try. Gave uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times. 
negative	Simple and straightforward! I would like the ability to share formatted reports via OneDrive/DropBox/GoogleDocs/Etc. Some additional graphing options would be nice as well.
negative	All photos have been blocked and can't post. I have tried to post multiple photos of my kids' Lego creations, and every photo has been "blocked by a moderator." And they are very simple and appropriate photos of Lego creations by 5 year olds. This seems like a very pointless app to me and I will be deleting. 
negative	Lol played for 5 minutes loss after loss. Play for actual money has better odds than this rubbish. Uninstalled 
negative	*** This review may contain spoilers *** This has to be one of the stupidest movies I have attempted to watch in quite awhile. It made absolutely no sense to me or my Husband.... The only reason we watched it was because Keanu Reeves was in it, and his part is pretty small actually. We really tried watching it and gave up after about 1/2 hour...Terrible script, terrible acting all around...Elle Fanning looked like she was a vapid idiot most of the time...We kept wondering how a 16 year old girl had enough money to live in a hotel, have such nice clothes etc. It just didn't make any sense...Why was there a mountain lion in her room? Did I miss something there, or was that some kind of symbolism for something I was supposed to figure out ? I just could not stand to watch it long enough to find out...We even tried to fast forward it to see if it got any better...It didn't...
negative	Match making sucks. All you get is frustrations, no fun. Clash Royale is way better. 
negative	The app was aweful and couldn't identify a single song i gave it. Even the studio versions of Grateful Dead songs I knew the names of, just to see if it was because the live version I was trying to identify wasn't on an album, didn't register 
negative	hand of midas nerf is a joke why that big nerf? kinda killed the game imo 
negative	This game is horrible. It is so pay to win cause if you don't pay you are getting attacked by people who spent their money to win. The people themselves are rude. The gameplay video is nothing like the actually gameplay. All they want is your money so the shove offers up your butt and it's annoying. Please don't waste your time or money on this stupid cheap pay to win game

negative	I haven't had such bad experience since i was born.We waited around half an hour to order,and once we ordered,it took 20 more minutes to just give us beer. we ordered food as well,but it didn't seem to rush them much(waited around 1 hour for food).So instead of waiting for our food we decided to eat 2 small sandwiches that we had with us, until they gave us our ordered food. Once one of the waiters saw that we ate something that we brought - he began shouting at as us as an uncivilized brat.I wouldn't set food in there if i were you.
negative	I purchased the product assuming that it would work on ... I purchased the product assuming that it would work on New Nintendo 3DS. But it does not. "Game Card Cannot be used".It was meant to be a gift for a friend in February only to open and find out that it does not work. The product description did not make it clear that it was locked to the US gaming region. Last time I'm trusting Amazon.com. If it does not work for consoles outside of the US manufacturing, why so freely open the market to international buyers? 
negative	Firstly, Liked all the actors. Do i think Vin cant act his way out of a wet paper bag or is it the directors direction that made me cringe every 3 mins? I think it was the crappy role, still like you Vin.This is one of those movies where all the "good" guys can shoot and kill every thing they nonchalantly point a gun at while doing acrobatics, yet ALL the "bad" guys couldn't hit the broadside of a barn standing 10 feet in front of it using a mini-gun and a truck load of ammunition!One more observation. EVERYONE in the movie looks like they just stepped off the stage of a GQ male model shoot or a Victoria secrets lingerie fashion show. Boring. Zero depth.Rating: 3 stars, 1 for each of the Asian guys and 1 for Deepok Shockra or whatever her name is, VERY beautiful. Hope to see her in more films. The cgi wasn't bad, never even thought about it.Atta boy Hound. ;)
negative	I sucks it does the first jump then you fall and dont even have the time to try to jump a second jump DONT TRY THIS STUPID APP 
negative	I cant learn anything when it shoves the option to pay for the better version down my throat I wanted to learn one damn song but I couldnt see the tab so it was impossible 
negative	I'm sorry but don't get this! This app is dumb!It is so laggy and really glitchy!DONT GET THIS GAME!TAKE MY ADVISE 
negative	Waste of Money. Spent $40 for the passport plan. Couldn't connect to wifi at all at Delhi airport. Tried using data, speed was extremely slow, WhatsApp call wouldn't work. It is only good for text messages and paid phone calls. Frustrating 😏 
negative	Nerfing the hand of midas killed the game. Now it's very very very very hard to advance in stages. Used to be a good game. Too bad. 
negative	It was horrible ,sorry but I like the actual game on cool math better than this times 100. 
negative	As received it was supposed to be Used -like new ... As received it was supposed to be Used -like new condition. It was defective. I contacted Dyson techs and they had me disassemble the unit and where there are 2 connectors next to the motor one was broken .The problem is that the beater bar would not always function at first then quit all together.Any piece of equipment can malfunction. The thing to remember ...in most cases BUY NEW. 
negative	It would not come on it would load all the way to 100%, and then it would go off EVERY TIME. I tried it 4-5 times at different times of the day. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars on everything. 
negative	Well, I would say if u want to get a new car, yes u can, but u have to play the game 24 hours. I want to get the EVO, but, there some chapter u can't win, because it shows is HARD. But u just have 5 tickets. If u used all of them, wait 37 mins, yeah, give u 1 ticket after 37 mins. Are u kidding? If u can't get the new car in the event, u don't have chance to get, the event of the game you miss, I can't get it again, like EVO 6, Charger, S15, R34, Mustang, Diablo. That is unfair for the guy play it later! One game have 2 resolution??? 
negative	I've been using schick razors for many years and recently have had 3 bad boxes in a row of poorly made razor refills for my quattro shaver. Each blade seems to have a sharp shave and my legs are as smooth as they should be. Not very happy !!
negative	Quite possibly the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.Decor was last done in the 80s for as little as possible. There was a tiny TV the size of an old fashioned computer monitor with trunking up the wall to hide the cable?! Lino on the bathroom floor. Say no more.Bar wasn't manned. No food or snacks. Depressing bar (even just to meet on in before going out).Spend a little more on your room unless your a back packer .. then it's sweet!
negative	I use my Samsung S7 which is an Android device of course. I really wish there would be an update where it could be the same on Apple devices which i hear myself through my earphones while i am singing and no need to adjust if my "voice is out of sync". I think it would be very very nice and i would really be happy for being a VIP member. But right now I'm just disappointed. Please fix it i now it'll take some time but i hope it will be soon coz i am one of those people who have subscriptions and actually are paying. Thank you s much. 
negative	EVERY time I submit a claim for a medical expense, they respond a week later that they don't like the wording of the doctors prescription, I often have to make 2 or 3 more visits to the the doctor for the sole reason of having him re-write notes... And even if he writes exactly what they ask, they deny it again, or then claim that there is something wrong with the receipt. It ends up taking me a month to get my money back and non-stop running around to jump thru ridiculous hoops that they seem to change on the fly. Judging my the other reviews this seems to be what they do to everyone.... What a terrible strain on our medical system making people go back to their doctors 2 and 3 times simply because this ridiculous company likes to stall on paying by demanding prescriptions and doctors notes be worded slightly different!!
negative	Supposedly the latest update included "improvements for reliability and speed." That may technically be accurate because ever since the update it reliably will not open. It keeps hanging up while loading and I have to force close it. This has caused me to spend less time on FB, also making it faster. 
negative	Ek toh bc jio walo n aise h speed kam kr rkhi h upr se ye chutiya game waste of mb 
negative	This game has stopped working for me (it kicks to home screen after loading). I've emailed the developers; no reply and will not be compensated although it is THEIR fault for a glitch update. Absolute garbage; I feel sorry for people who have actually spent money in the game who are getting the same GARBAGE service. FOFL Scopely! 
negative	Trending Music Player. Horrible. You can't exit the app without the music stopping. You can't turn off your device without the app stop playing the music 
negative	Do people actually give you money?Idiots.You know..nevermind you $hitheads. 
negative	Pika pika pikachu! (Never ever try this app) 
negative	Living in Boston we get fairly frequent windy days. However, the first time that I used this umbrella it wasn't very windy. The wind "gusts" (if you can even call them that) were maybe 1-2 mph. This umbrella immediately turned inside-out at the slightest hint of wind.
negative	No puedo abrir nada, absolutamente nada! Y encima de eso, "no se aceptan devoluciones". Que conveniente!
negative	The app. Was very good but now there is aproblem where is the comment option why it empity Please solve it fast 
negative	Garbage. Will no longer activate license and start despite paying for full app. 
negative	Once again, too many intrusive ads. Option for ads free from the start, would be helpful. 
negative	After the valentines update, it keeps on crashing. 
negative	READ BEFORE YOU BUY I bought this Hard Drive as of April 2016 and not only did it come as a 2TB HDD, but within 10 months made the dreaded clicking noises aka the death of a Hard Drive. This hard drive is not worth the money as it dies in less than a year. I am a moderate gamer and used this hard drive for most of my games and for misc. files while I used my SSD as my boot drive. When I ordered this exact 3tb model it ended up being a 2tb hard drive and worked fine at first, but be weary of this because it will DIE within a year. Look at all the other reviews - all the same problem with the same bogus "2 year warranty". 
negative	Why do old one keep bring me back here?! 
negative	Please fix this app, none of the friend invites to like my page are being sent, I send only about 20 a day. To makes matters worse now with the latest update the scheduled posts aren't working. 
negative	Does not work with Google Chrome browser, \r\nIf I adjust the motion detection to #2 it won't pick up a person walking, if I set it to #3 it picks up the slightest motion, piece paper anything, you get constant alerts or you get none at all.\r\nI can't get images off of NVR from computer or monitor, I haven't tried a thumb drive yet
negative	They wont even let you use the app to see how it works without they're stupid free trail crap in you face. 
negative	Update 1/17- app no longer seems to be functioning despite having uninstalled & reinstalled several times, and no recent app update either. Devs- don't put out Windows apps & then abandon them! :-( We appreciate your efforts! (orig 2016 review).... I'm glad I found this app - will hopefully help me not "overcharge" quite as often and overall increase batt life at least a little. So far its doing what its supposed to do. Thanks developers!
negative	Quit after 10 months I purchased this vacuum cleaner 10 months ago with high hopes based on prior Amazon reviews. I had used a Dyson for many years prior and bought this to replace it when it wore out after 7 years of use. Now, not even one year after my purchase, my Shark is not functional. The rotating brush does not turn on. It just stopped working out of the blue - this morning it worked fine, and now the brush will not move at all. Very disappointed. I was hoping to find a more affordable replacement for the Dyson but if I have to pay $250 every 10 months this clearly is not the most financially feasible option. 
negative	Zero app. don't waste time by downloading it. 
negative	Update 1.2.3 just killed the game for me, pushed my Max Stage really hard with Heart of Midas. Now i can't farm Equipment because i can't reach that high of a Stage anymore because of the Heart of Midas nerf... 
negative	Ugh I deleted all my apps and it still not working 
negative	Waste of time... Please friends don’t Install diz app.... 👎 
negative	One Star Died 14 months after purchase. Didn't drop it. Was hardly plugged in or in use. 
negative	Not a fan of the update myself, it's all over the place and there's too much going on in one screen for my liking. I'll use another AFL app from now on 
negative	It's an awesome game if they could only figure out how games actually work. Not much makes sense still. I've been playing soccer the game started and the drop rate has made it clear that it is pay to win only and it is very pricy. Im not against spending on a game, but why would I waste my money. Four legendary including the ones you give for completions since the game started. I helped support this game and just got disappointment in return. 
negative	Disappointed I purchased this item on November 17, 2016 and died on me last night February 2, 2017. Lasted less than three months. I would like to say that I really took care of this item not even a scratch, don't really understand how such a cheap item be so expensively, I really thought I was making a smart good quality purchase. I just ordered a 2nd one same brand different model and like the other one it is a 5TB. 
negative	App quits when I try to open my ticket. When I try to click tickets and passes, the app quits. Please fix it or let me know how I can fix it on my side.This is still an issue on the newest release. 
negative	So i have to update the whole game but ihave no more storage, so i unstalled my current app and then install it back again. The thing is, i was returned to lvl 1 but my progress was not fully restored. I have my relics but not the fragments i should receive every time we prestige. I was auto prestiged without getting my frags. 
negative	I bought it. I rated it. It keeps begging for a rating. And not in a way that can easily be cancelled. G D annoying... It stopped after a while but the latest update brought it back. Leave me the hell alone, you already have my money!!! Now I cannot access any "pro" content anymore even after I paid them money. Screw these guys. 
negative	Didn't work well and ended up locking me out so lost everything on my phone. Would NOT recommend. Ever. 
negative	I will be writing a letter to the property owner about my stay. I thought I would give all the mixed reviews the benefit of the doubt since people's preferences vary.. but I was wrong. The place is gross period. Those pictures are very misleading.... Do not stay here. I wish there was a way to get my money back! Only reason why we didn't go anywhere else is because we were on a tight budget and we'd lose the pre-paid room.
negative	I have been playing this game for about 2 years now and I'm finding the challenges to be worthless. One of the challenges a while back was win one bonus game I won 9 and still it would not register I had to delete the game and put it back on and when one a tenth time to get it to register. Now today's challenge is when two bonus games on Terminator 2 I have spun over 300 times lost 183 million and still have not got one bonus 
negative	Pls fix this. Whenever i touch the screen so it will identify my face for filter. It failed and it also dont have gallery. The little circle below the bigger circle for capturing. If i take a picture and save it in memory, it autosave in my camera roll. I love the filters that snapchat have. Pls fix this. Im using android phone. I uninstall it for now. Because it consume big memory space in my phone. 
negative	 Kingston 32GB DataTraveler SE9 USB 2.0 Flash Drive (DTSE9H\/32GBZ)Pros: Technically, the drive does "work" -- it can be formatted and it is possible to copy files to/from the device.Cons: Benchmarked results using 10 MB sample size: 27 MB/s read rate, 2.5 MB/s write write. My real-world transfer speeds to the device are typically < 1 MB/s -- making this drive unusable for most practical purposes.Other Thoughts: Would not recommend. 
negative	Very very ba please don't. Waste your net 
negative	Too many ads. Unstable controlling with tilt sensitivity. .. . . 
negative	S many ads. Completely unplayable. Don't waste your time. 
negative	This doesn't even look like it works for desktop. During setup, it asks you to connect your Windows PHONE to a specific WiFi network. I'm afraid to use the app for my phone now because I don't want my large RAW files using up all that memory. I already have a camera that saves to my phone's storage... it's my phone.
negative	It was awful!. This app sucked I could not locate the single ringtone that I downloaded and they charged me until I was out of credits 
negative	Laggy and crashes few time.. couple time re and uninstall but still the same. By the way, mine is s6 edge so please don't tell me I have a lousy phone 
negative	It was horrible! Roaches in the room, hair in the tub and on towels, towels had stains, towels and blanks smelled, one bed was so hard it felt like i was on a board... Staff was beyond rude, so much attitude and ugly faces, they do not care for you just your money. Ruined my whole trip. When we complained they said to take it up with the website we booked the hotel from.
negative	You get a one star only because of how unstable your servers are. And nobody can blame their internet seeing as you have a Resolve Lag button in the damn game. Fix the lag and this game will easily be a 5star. 
negative	The app ran too slow and it was full ads!!!! 
negative	Used to love the game. But after my account went missing and a week later still no help. To the point they won't open my tickets anymore is utterly disgusting. If you play this game and spend money on it . It can be taken just like that and no help to get it back. Support is bs. So ATM I would not suggest anyone play this game and 1 star rating would be to generous for a company that can do this to its customers.... 
negative	This game is so rigged. I can't seem to win anything anymore. It used to be a lot of fun to play. 
negative	 Seagate 5TB Backup Plus Hard Drives - Portable External USB 3.0 Model STDR5000103 RedPros: Large capacityCons: -I have been using this drive for less that 1 week and the drive is already non-functional.-The HDD arm clicks when the drive tries to seek.-No computer will now recognize the drive.Other Thoughts: -Seagate, where is your QA? 
negative	It is really difficult to validate new characters or make changes to old ones nor could a find a way to update new pics 
negative	SC will never change. Battery drain has never been fixed. drain likely due to the constant location demand (& the camera use), doubled by the inconsistent video mode, which often crashes the app, occasionally taking the whole phone with it into an auto restart. Almost every time I go to take a video I'm worried the app will crash. Often the video "hold button" fails a couple seconds into it and cuts the video short. Why not just do a start/stop button? I really hate this app. Yet I'm still using it smh ugh 
negative	This app is perfect, I would rate it ten stars if I could, I've been using it since high school, and now I'm almost two years into college and I use it just as much as ever. I even upgraded to the pro version and turned it onto my younger brother. Recently however, the app did not want to start up on my computer. Every time I tried to open the app, it showed the loading screen and immediately closed. It had been working for over a year and I've never had an issue like this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but now I can't even sign into my account. Thank goodness there's a web version of this app, but I very much liked having the desktop app. Is there anyway I can get this fixed? I'll bump my rating back up to five stars if I can get some help.
negative	Rip off of another game The server names arent even related to the characters in the game i get it if it was a poksmon game but come on 
negative	Not using it anymore! I really don't need it. I My choice Correct? Well, NOT WHEN IT IS NOT PRE INSTALLED. *** The app overall is good. But Not when it's CONSTANTLY UPDATING itself on My tablet!!! How DOES this app keep Installing when I've All update notifications OFF!? 😯 AND I DO MEAN EVERYWHERE! seriously ~ LOOK INTO THIS Google. Thank you! 😊 
negative	This is the worst gif maker I have ever used. It lowers the quality of the images and has extremely limited speeds for what it can do.
negative	First two days with the app were great now all of a sudden my account has been blocked and I can't access it all. It's saying suspicious activity but I haven't don't anything other then talk to 2 people and send messages to a few others that never replied. Unless my account is reactivated the rating stays at one this is stupid . 
negative	Since update will now not load just says not responding 
negative	You would think that because its on its fifth that its would be better.... Wrong! Its worse than dungeon hunter 4. The loot system is terrible... Plays like a gambling game. It doesn't have real coop(only some hoard mode that always fails to connect). I'm pretty sure it uses a.i. for other people by default any way (tested with friends). Why can't some one make a decent dungeon crawler. What I would do for diablo 2 or path of exile like game on a phone . 
negative	YouTube reply notifications broken. You are notified when someone replies to your comment but only shows the original post. YouTube app must be opened and comments must be scoured through in order to see the replies. Massively inconvenient and frustrating, please fix this crap. 
negative	Horrible. It has popups that keep popping up faster than you can read the i fo on the page Absolutely Horrible
negative	Its fame is baffling, its taste is questionable and its attraction unfathomable. Next to the little Mermaid statue in Copenhagen, which kneels in a patch of aquatic rubbish, the Jeanneke Pis must be the most over-rated attraction in Europe. Doesn't even have the vulgar charm? of its male counterpart.
negative	i called try to get my dog in there its very sick and they said cash only.i dont make much a mouth they are no payments at this place.they rather to have there money first.i thought they are a veteran s. they are a joke i will not go there ever. 
negative	I think this app just shows the developer what to download for their personal playlist.
negative	Waste of money The light would be red, indicating a high allergen count, then turn yellow as it ran, then finally blue. Within a few minutes of it turning blue, it would go right back to red. This happened over and over again and after a week of use, my allergy symptoms were getting so bad that I had to wear an allergy mask *inside* the house. I ended up returning the unitAlso a warning for those who use a CPAP, don't use the ionization feature if you're using the purifier anywhere near where you're sleeping. It may only produce a small amount of ozone, but the CPAP forces you to breathe deeper than you normally would so the O3 will have a much stronger effect on you. 
negative	Will not work on custom ROMs. Doesn't matter if they're rooted or not. I've tried every un-root method/app available and all say that my phone isn't even rooted! Terrible. 
negative	It's a fake I generated gems they said 24 to 48 hours it will be delivered it's 3rd day I didn't get a single gem 
negative	It keeps crashing i run it but then a couple minutes later it goes to home screen 
negative	My name in this game is my first and last name, and I dont want that. You shouldnt have the right to use my email to create a name for me. 
negative	Bought this game 2 days ago and it worked fine now doesn't work at all today, just a frozen screen to start then it crashes. Please fix it, I have an upset child who wants their game to work. 
negative	Crystal was very friendly and helpful at the front desk.
negative	Poor playback options. Not sure if I'm writing a review about Prime Video the app or Prime Video the service, but I find both of them hard to take full advantage of. I frequently can't use it on my computer due to resolution/format issues, whatever that means. And I can't stream to Chromecast via the app. Both seem to be limitations purposely built into the program. I view this as an effort to deliver less than the best, and I won't reward purposeful mediocrity in a review 
negative	HOW IS THIS APP POPULAR, THEY DON'T LISTEN TO REVIEWS AND I CAN'T GO THROUGH 1 STORY WITHOUT IT CRASHING!!! I TRIED 5 DIFFERENT TIMES TO WATCH VIDEOS ON ONE DISCOVER STORY AND IT CRASHED EVERYTIME... SNAP! CAN YOU HEAR US!... so new look and still same crashing bs, honestly, I can't wait for the snapchat fad to fade so we can move on to a higher standard of developer/customer communication and higher standard of quality apps... 
negative	Told by the organizers that I would get a link to download the app. But didn't get it. Downloaded manually from playstore. Worst thing is that program details not updated at all and we did not receive any hardcopy of scientific session. Had to download that too from Cancer CI website. And QR scanner not picking anything up from the brochure. Needs a lot of work with the app. Gave 2 stars (otherwise a 1star for the app) only for the reception and help from the volunteers for helping with the registration. 
negative	NOT FOR APPLE Althought it said the opposite (that it would work) It DOES NOT work with apple. 
negative	If Only It Worked! Frequently doesn't work and spits out the dust and debris no matter how many times you clean it. Maybe they just gave me a faulty one. The only good thing about this product is that it is cordless and light weight. 
negative	This app is awful!. This app is one of the worst app I have had! It closes out and crashes all the time, AND the ringtones are either really stupid or offensive! It is very racist to Indian people and one of the talking ringtones sounded like an autistic person and that is when I deleted the app. The creators honestly make me sick!😡 The only reason I gave this app one star is because that is the only was it would let me submit this review, it really needs -5 stars! Never get this app EVER!! 
negative	Most stupid thing ever it is in Spanish and I don't know what it says and it will not change languages 
negative	Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse The app sucked enough to begin with but this update takes the cake for the worst app ever invented. Stunned that you get away with this BS. Won't be long before you perish into oblivion lol. Instagram is stealing all your ideas and pulling them off better. Plus you block rooted phones. You freedom haters should get off this open source platform then and move to some locked down OS or join forces with Sony and create some super steroid DRM crap. That's about the level. You've failed at Android life. Kthxbai 
negative	Rate: 1 stars -No unlock code was received for a week. Submitted a support ticket on the site that supposedly has live support but I didn't receive a response or an acknowledgement of receipt of my ticket. No unlock code, no update on status. ...I actually need a phone for work and can't be waiting around for ages for an unlock code...this certainly isn't the "fastest unlock speed on the internet" that the website claims. So I just end up using another service and emailed for a refund. It has now been a full week of my initial email request for a refund (politely, I must add). No response, no acknowledgment of anything... I will be reporting this company to my credit card company. Thanks for nothing, Cellphoneunlocker.com. Useless.
negative	I used to love this game but since the last update, when I turn it on or finally get in the game or play ANYTHING at all it tells me I have to download more content. I have had to download content over 60 times in the last 3 days. HORRIBLE! It males me want to never play this again! Which sucks BC I spent a lot of time on it. Fix this. ASAP 
negative	At first I liked it but now I don't because it messed up my phone and it froze it and I had to take it apart. 
negative	how sad that even if u buy the full version still have to dish out all kinds of money nope dont think so delete waste of data and time 
negative	Update destroyed everything. New UI is unintuitive. New intrusive / pop-up adds. Filled to the brim with in-game purchases. Game now lags like crazy. Don't fix it if it ain't broken. This app is basically adware now. 
negative	I paid for the first app now I have to pay again? I think not. RIP OFF. 
negative	While I enjoy free prints to actually have and to be able to clear up space on my phone, I DONT find this app user friendly at all. I've been close to tears too many times!! Customer support is quick and willing to help.
negative	NOT what I expected.. can't use AT&T Samsung tab with it, LOTS of come on for monthly charge I got the Amazon fire tv from reccomendation of AT&T salwa, ro help speed up direct tv on rablet, and ro "mirror" from phone AND TABLET that I got as "bundle"from AT&T. Called Amazon support for help with set up. Was first told that Amazon fir tv was designed for Amazon phones,and tablets. Later was told it would work with Samsung phone, but not with the tablet from AT&T...While setting up, and trying to get apps , I find most of "free" app down loads ARE NOT FREE, but a week to month free "teaser bait" to get a automatic credit payment after the trial.. CHECK ALL THE 1 STAR REVIEWS FOR APPS FROM AMAZON .. also complicated to set mirroring each time I turn on tv.. then it goes to sleep while watching or listening ro music.., 
negative	Gave me nothing but gibberish. No documentation, no refunds, total ripoff.
negative	Do not buy this app literally doesn't even open half the time. Waste of money. if I could put zero stars I would.
negative	I have heard a lot about amazon and i also wanted to buy many things but amazon is not for my country. I was so disappointed, Well I will still give 1 star and will later turn it into 4 if they really do it internationally. They only say internationally but only include 15 or 20 countries I think. Other people or sites do allow to do shipping from amazon but it is so expensive that most people can't afford. Well I live in Pakistan. 
negative	Never again do I buy a Seagate drive These drives are terrible.I purchased a Backup Plus Slim 2 in August last year for Mac Time Machine backups. The drive crapped out 4 months later. I contacted Seagate for a replacement as the drive was still under warrantee, which they happily did for a charge of $10. I received the replacement drive less than a month ago...and guess what? I was hoping the first drive was a fluke, but that is not the case. The replacement drive crapped out a couple weeks ago. There's no way I will request another drive.Do yourself a favor and save yourself the time, money, and possible loss of data - don't buy this drive. 
negative	I can't get it to function the way it should. Please advise.
negative	The app doesn't even open I just get a message that the app has crashed and to send report Could the developer please look into it 
negative	This app crashes after the first use. It closes as soon as I choose backup. Since my phone will not connect to the computer anymore (unrecognizable device error) it is very frustrating that this app is not working for Windows 10. Please update!
negative	Major Design Flaw I had it for about 2 months when it started not having very good suction. I cleaned it all out just as the Service Chat Line suggested but I noticed that the seal between the detachable dirt receptacle and the vacuum stick was warped. This seal is critical to getting good suction. I can't really bend it back and I can see leaves a gap in a seal that should be tight. The Service Chat Line said I need to take it to a local service center but that is 25 miles away. I'm not really happy with that plan. Seems like a design flaw that I'm being made to go out of my way to fix. And who's to say it won't happen again. 
negative	It was tje same as the other game juju on that beet and its nearly imposdible to play plus it aint got nout do with dr phill and cash me outsidr 
negative	This is your first item in the feature list. How is this done? Is this still supported? Thanks.
negative	Crashes all the time ...oops- oopss - opsss...fix it 
negative	This was suggested by the app store to open PL1 files. It doesn't work!
negative	Nothing like it was advertised at all. Take it down!! 
negative	I think this is not a good game to play. It's the EXACT same game as juju on dat beat which was also a bad game too and this had nothing to do with cash me outside or doctor Phil so I recommend not to download it 
negative	Drive arm failure. Horrible! It failed only days before Amazon's return window closed. The mechanical arm was getting held up. It took me a couple weeks to move my data in small sections. I was lucky for that. So, now I can't return it. Poor product. Disappointed in Amazon, as well. 
negative	While the levels are too repetitive, they trick you into playing and charging you blue coins to continue replenishing lives. When you run out of those blue coins(which happens quick) to continue playing you will pay ALLOT OF MONEY!!! Stay away. 
negative	Doesn't even play. Force close the first time, now clicking the icon doesn't launch anything. 
negative	Don't buy! Poorly made. Multiple strings broke upon tuning. Strings get loose right away and wont hold. Lesson learned; you get what you pay for. 
negative	Huuuge scam. Wasted my money for no reason. Real money for fake money? Game makers are smart, but greedy. Until you confirm with concrete proof that the slots are 100% random, I'm not spending one more penny on it, and I hope no one else does either. I hope karma comes for you Huuge. 
negative	I have the note 5. I have the pro version of bike race. It will not give me the world tour. I have tried reinstalling and it still doesn't work. Please fix. This should be a 5 star rated game. Or explain to me why it won't work. 
negative	Case looked real nice, but it was too small for the camera,plus it wouldn't close
negative	 Kingston 32GB DataTraveler SE9 G2 USB 3.0 Flash Drive, Speed Up to 100MB\/s (DTSE9G2\/32GB)Pros: Kingston has always been reliable - this time not so much.Cons: All of these 32 GB flash drives have had multiple failures and show up with only 200 MB of space on PC . When I reformat they no longer work on a Windows machine and are only visible on Macs. Found a way to completely erase and reset but they are still hit-or-miss on the WIndow's systems. This batch much have been bad.Other Thoughts: Buyer be aware. Very surprised given the great history I have with their products. Disappointed. 
negative	I cannot stress enough to not buy this TV. It takes a full 1 minute 30 seconds from powering on to using any of the smart applications. This was verified with two separate brand new TV's three different networks with speeds ranging from 6Mbps all the way to 200Mbps. I contacted Samsung and apparently the issue is the TV has to "register" its self each time it is powered on through Samsung's servers before any of the smart applications can be used. I will definitely not be buying another Samsung product after this. 
negative	This is my horrible dont get this thing it only loads and it never gets the game statrted bye 
negative	Im the unhappiest gameloft player here. I lost all my progress without uninstalling the game. I am not a hacker and I often report hackers. I was rank 14 in mulitplayer and had around 3370 blueprints and was about to buy katepan. But lost all my progress though valor points are still the same. I cannot even play multiplayer anymore Gameloft doesnt resolve my issue despite contacting them. They just give me a ticket number but dont solve them. Worst experience ive ever had gaming. Will change and update my review if gameloft resolves my query. Bad customer service n unfair. I worked and played a lot to get all my rewards and guns. 
negative	This game is based around who hase the highest level because all the low levels dont have the good wepons and have to deal with that the entire game until they manage to level up 
negative	Do something about the missing GPS! If other app like Google Map, Facebook etc can detect my GPS, why is your app giving me a hard time to play the game? And the avatar + buddy icon freezes my screen when I tab it. Your game is getting irritating. 
negative	Terrible! The app is extremely confusing and freezes a lot!! I'm extremely disappointed, because I thought this app would be decent but it's garbage. Definitely deleting. 
negative	Game isnt worth playing. Support staff is non-existant. Claim they deal with cheaters yet have allowed whole guilds to start alt accounts contrary to thier rules and then dont follow through when proof is provided to them if cheats. Game requires spending very large quantities of cash to get anywhere. Has no built in stops to prevent the largest players from killing the smallest new guy. And again if the largest guy starts a second or third farm account, unless you choose to cheat yourself, there is no defense. I think once a cheat is reported with proof that they should be removed from the game and all accounts deleted. Dont waste time with game. Not worth the hassle. 
negative	Nerfed skills and therefor made them useless. MOST skills are useless as is; Now they made Hand Of Midas just as useless. It was an okay way to wastebsome spare time. Now its not. 
negative	Don't. half the players are cheating and they do nothing about it cause they're the ones cheating people out of they're phoney money. 
negative	I can't seem to be able to install this app. Can you fix that!?! I have a PC with Windows 10 and a phone with Windows 10 Mobile. I think it should work on both of them.
negative	 Kingston 8GB DataTraveler 100 G3 USB 3.0 Flash Drive (DT100G3\/8GB)Pros: Pretty and cheap, use for loaners when you don't expect it back(must have lost ten drives that way).Cons: Just because the inside is blue, does not mean its a 3.0 drive. The download time of 5 min compared to 30 sec of a true 3.0 flash drive is misleading advertising. Although the packaging does state, USB 3.1/3.0/2.0.Other Thoughts: NO, only as a 2.0 drive. 
negative	Too many ADS on every side. Not easy to use. Every option asked me to open new file. and it only played video. No "CUT" buttons
negative	Cant do anything with put another person 
negative	The "Store" recommended this app to open "Pages" document in windows. Doesn't do squat! I can see more of the file in notepad
negative	It sucked. Did not like the product and did not like the people that installed it. Got a new pair of washer and dryer. 
negative	I can't figure out how to make use of this app. How could I rate it? All of my photos have been changed to thumbnail. I can't change them or view them. Not to say that WOWSee is responsible. I don't know what is responsible?
negative	Hey nk, hacked the game, got flagged. Found out how to unflag myself and now I'm able to join clans and see leader boards. I wish you goodluck trying to get me banned or flagged :^) 
negative	If you get a message and dont read it right away, you will never find it again. Why!? 
negative	It's not updating the plans of operator I recharged my bsnl no for 139 for 1 GB data written in paytm it came only 300 MB it's the fault of paytm it gave wrong information.
negative	Takes about 10 seconds to respond after I do anything, if it bothers to do anything at all. Telstra should stick to telephony sevices and leave app making to those who know what they're doing. 
negative	Update 2.2.1 (or whatever it was) with valentines day ruined the game. Skills: Heart of midas has been nerfed down and is now useless, Flash zip and Ultra heroes is not usable due to stupid heart button placement. Usability: due to same placement issue the tapping became a nonsence when pushing the button by accident. I've invested a lot of skill points into skills mentioned and now they're useles. Waste of time. 
negative	No good. Cannot understand nor get to hook up to my computer. Buy another product
negative	One Star Spews water all over the clothes while ironing. I have tried to adjust the steam control but without success. 
negative	It's supposed to back up to the micro usb card; when inserted into the carrier and then into the computer, no back up appears. it shows the card as D drive on my windows laptop, but when you go to the folder no current backups appear. last back up, according to the usb card, was last October.
negative	Charged me double and never got refunded. I requested gett from laguardia airport and the fares showing was $32, but when I looked up my bill ob my card, I was charged double $64. Make sure you check your bill.The driver came on time, but then said that the app could not get his location so he had to go out of the airport and then come back (20min drive in traffic). All that time, he tried to reach the rep on the phone but nobody was picking up.I wasted time and it was an unpleasant trip and I got double charged. I sent an email to get refunded, but they did not even reply to my email. Terrible app and service.I just checked the app and once I was told I would be harged $20 and then I got charged $49. Something is definitely wrong with their system. 
negative	wish I could figure it out every time I get a picture from the cloud and I put it in choose photo. it disapears
negative	The animal went too fast but level 1 to 3 is not that bad . If you ask me I will quit this game long ago if it is boring and the person making this game does not know how to think for others first before making this game .LOL tiis game is no way on the line for anybody to play The person making this game forget about winning others people haert on this game it us nowhere on anybodys mind and the service is then worst than I thought ( LOUSY ) 
negative	Would it be such a bad thing to invest in new beds and pillows? Good grief! When your butt is about to hit the floor, it may be time to retire the mattress.
negative	I don't like you because everytime I touch the screen it doesn't work and also with this game is stupid and also just too many ads 
negative	Too bad it doesn't use the slant views of Bing Maps. More important, it wants to handle all my pictures, but after some errors I figured how to make it handle just my new ones. Two pictures landed 30m west of the right spot, probably due to my other errors, but these various errors used up my quota and now I can't retag the pictures. That leaves me no way to find out whether it can work properly. Anyway I learned generally about how this kind of program should work, and maybe can evaluate its competitors before using up the trial quota they give me.
negative	Same bullshit app as another garbage app on Google Play. Don't waste your time! 
negative	 ASUS ZenWatch 3 Android Wear Smartwatch with Quick Charge & Gunmetal Case, Dark Brown Leather Strap (WI503Q-GL-DB) US WarrantyPros: Not sure, I am responding to the product one of the other reviews.Cons: I was going to buy this watch, however upon reading the review about the band breaking within so many days of purchase and the manufacture claiming it was accidental damage and not covering it, I am going to go with another company. The band was obviously faulty and should have been covered under warranty. I can't imagine being treated this way about a brand new product. I have had Asus products in the past and been particularly pleased with them, but to not replace a $10 watch band seems a little to persnickety. You may have lost more than 2 customers, thank you David H. for the extensive review 
negative	Loved the stay, ,clean room , hotel is in the middle of the strip, loved that they had a shampoo, conditioner and body soap dispenser on the wall ! i will come back here again to stay! only issue was the printing of boarding pass ticket which cost $5 to print--per Concierge services which was not very helpful. I hope this will be free next time and concierge will be 24 hours open in the future.
negative	Many bugs need to be fixed. Like it auto cleans its cache thus we need to reload the stories which we have seen . 
negative	TERRIBLE PRODUCT. BITS FALLING OFF AND NOT WORKING. MANUFACTURER BAD!!! This product is terrible. I've never written a negative review on anything before. I purchased this as I needed something lightweight to use to do a little vacuuming after a major spine surgery. From the first week, parts fell off the item. A replacement head was sent and again the same part fell off the product. I asked for a newer model as I believe this has been a problem with this model. No response, another head was sent. After using it a few times, it didn't pick bits up. I've hardly used this item and now I'm asking for a refund again and the manufacturer aren't answering my emails. I paid a decent amount of $s the purchased this product and I expect value by use. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND THIS PRODUCT. BE CAREFUL. 
negative	A great game that's ruined by terrible PvP mechanics. PvP is not opt-in, which means anyone can attack you. But there's nothing separating high and low level players, or incentivizing not attacking much lower levels. This means that established players are constantly ruining the experience of newbies. I can't give the game any higher than a single star until this is fixed. 
negative	Drive malfunctioning after 1 month of use. I've only had this harddrive for a month and it's already malfunctioning. The disk won't spin and the PC won't read the drive at all. Don't waste your time or money. 
negative	Push notifications always fail. Pathetic 
negative	Closing the ads are impossible without being pushed to the playstore, pixel 
negative	The shower was awful. Never got warm so we had to take cold showers. We got woken up at 8am every morning to loud sound outside
negative	When I opened the chest with the last of my gems, I had gotten a very rare armor. I go to equip it and it is nowhere to be found. I'd been really excited to get it, to. The armor was the wildfire torchplate 
negative	It drains my battery life like crazy. The UI is clunky, not very user-friendly, and needs an option to remove irrelevant social feed posts. The only worthwhile feature is being able to view my friends' and boyfriend's stories, which is why I haven't deleted it yet. 
negative	I hate this app more than clickbait. My heart sinks when I search google images and something I like is from Pinterest. Overbearing, pushy interface forces you use the dumb app, promising it'll be great; once you do actually download and use it, it's quite disappointing. Can't help but notice: if an application has to force you to use it, it probably sucks! Rot in hell with Bing, Pinterest!! 
negative	Ridiculous. The ads completely blocked me from doing ANYTHING. Deleted within minutes 
negative	Worst app. A big city Visakhapatnam's name as location not appeared. Alas. Look into this atleast now. 
negative	With the most recent update we are no longer able to search for items by typing in the name, we must now scroll through thousands of items. This issue needs to be corrected immediately or we will be forced to move to one of your competitors. 
negative	Total rip off of clash Royale. This game needs to be banned 
negative	I went in for lower back relief and left with a strained shoulder blade. I agreed to come back for her to "fix" it but only if she would not charge me for the treatment. Not only did they charge me fo r the 2nd treatment, she injured the same exact spot AGAIN. 6 years later, the spot she injured still gets tweaked and I fear it will never heal. She also committed insurance fraud by claiming she was adjusting me at least 3 days a week which I learned from my insurance provider. 
negative	How do I change this rating to ZERO? From bad to even worse. Now the app even ask me to rate it 5 Stars every time I exit it? Really? I seriously cannot believe that Sony bundles this with their premium Z range of phones. Old rating: I also used to love FK. But now definitely NOT liking all the nagging upgrade messages on a paid app. And the adds and nagging messages are getting worse. 
negative	It's a bad app I can't even download a game if you download it you should delete it 
negative	Im addict at musically but it jas a problem please musically fix this app it error occured time out and i cant use this app for 1month....please fix this I already reset my phone and its not even working still the same... I'm using oppo f1s please fix this... I'm hoping that it can back to normal😣😭😭😭😭 
negative	They only care about making money and not about their patients. My son was not seen for 9 weeks for his ortho and when I complained, the owner Stew said that he "wished he had gotten rid of us as pat ients months ago." When I said I didn't feel valued as a patient, his response was, "I'm running a business here, you need to go elsewhere."I couldn't believe he was saying that to me. I then met with him in person and he continued to reiterate that he was running a business and that was what mattered, not his patients.So if you are looking for a dentist or are currently with them, I would change immediately before you have a similar experience. I would recommend Dr. Byrd in Frederick or Hagerstown, he cares about his patients. Especially if you live in the Villages of Urbana and became part of his practice since he bought it out. Change now. 
negative	Why are you giving around 300 mb update everyday, take time & give proper solution 
negative	enough forced accounts and forced dumb cheery characters!!! 
negative	Doesn't allow you to save file when transferred via Bluetooth, the file is completely hidden from access outside the app. Walk everyone involved to the front door and do not let them back in.
negative	I hate it i cant play cuz thers no players and i hate it AND I DONLOWDIT AND I OPEN AND I WAIT UNTIL 2 HORS IT DIT WOR &gt;:
negative	A significant step backwards from the Eyefi version. Doesn't work and no way to solve problems. It's almost as if Eyefi's new owners are deliberately trying to kill off the product.
negative	One Star It stop giving steam after a few month of use 
negative	Same thing the other one did overwhelmed by all the ads and Bs you have got to go through just to search for a song once you find it a as pops up and you have to start over WTF 
negative	Only way to get good cards is to pay tons of money. Then you play in rumble against people that paid tons of money to get good cards and a huge health advantage. The most pay to win game I've ever seen. Just one huge repetitive cash grab. The default rewards are absolutely garbage. Pay to win, cash grab, garbage. 
negative	Why is this game so hard The control s are hard to 
negative	Never worked This product never worked. The light turns on but computer cannot access it. Unfortunately, the return window expired so I am stuck with it. 
negative	Remote set departure time still not working. This used to work in the old i3 app. Has not worked for me since December. I've opened a case with BMW, taken it to Service. They also opened a case with BMW. Was finally told the app isn't working as intended. Taking way too long to fix the app. 
negative	Garbage. I bought it and I got it broken. the spray doesn't work.Garbage. 
negative	After purchased for months now cant use anymore because the liscence not valid anymore.Tried everything still doesnt work. Cheating 
negative	Nothing works. Worst app I've ever seen. Can't type PIN to download. Adhaar number just disappears when we move to next box while checking linked status. When verifying only space moves nothing shows up. I hope someone is not paid hefty sum to make this worthless app. 
negative	Don't know if it works or not, forces closes every single time I try to use it. It's a waste of $2 at this point. 
negative	Frozen Screen. Okay I understand the need to add advertisement links to these apps. What I don't understand is why this app doesn't give the option to "close" the pop up or "X" out of it. I won't even get through creating my image before the advertisement pops up and freezes me out of the app. The only way I can get back to what I was doing was either to A) turn my phone off and back on or B) wait an hour or two until it reboots. Also for the record I have clicked on the ads, thinking maybe if I click on it and "pretend I'm interested" it will let me back into my app....wrong.This is literally my first app review because I'm so annoyed. I LOVED this app when I first got it, but now with its update I can't use it.Seems like a simple fix 
negative	Installed but never opened. One of the "permissions" is to make and manage phone calls. What app, especially for kids needs that. 
negative	Useless Adware If u dont have Internet the app wont let u open your file. Anyfile you launch will first show u advertisement. No other way around it. And no limit to the ads u can get one each time you open a file. came preinstalled wit the phone wil have to disable it. 
negative	Used to work fine. Now I get this "Are you human" crap time after time. Please fix or count me out 
negative	Only good for a few months I bought this iron 6 months ago and I currently have the cord duct taped at a certain angle to keep the power on. I thought this was supposed to be a higher end iron but this is the third Shark iron I've bought in a few years. I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt but I will not buy a Shark again. The same model that I had previous to this iron stopped steaming and would only spray water or dry iron. 
negative	Will never by again from Walmart. Expiration date January 2017. They were already stale.
negative	5* - that was my original impression but damn it is not optimised on Android, it plays, loads and performs much better on iOS iPhone 6s and iPad mini 3. even though I play on Android nVidia Shield and HTC10 both of which are powerful devices. 4*. And if you are committed to your account you can't switch to iOS. 3*. Weekend events regularly cause issues. 2*. I have had an issue were some one types a message on iOS which has an emoji and on Android you cant see the whole sentance. 1*. I love it though... 
negative	Didn't let me refund it and it's take like 12 million years to download 
negative	WAS all nice and high ranked with a great clan but the moment I rated it..Made me start from complete zero deleting everything WTF is this bullshit gave you 5stars before and you guys crashed on me a few times but this is pure bullshit 
negative	THEY CHANGED BUT DID NOT TELL US \r\nWe have used these VF napkins forever. Last year in 2016, they added the words \"Soft to the Touch\" and changed how the napkins are made and how well they (don't) work. The embossing is now very shallow, they are slippery and are too soft... like a tissue used to blow your nose. They feel thinner and don't open up as easily. We have found something at my grocery store that works like VFR used to and is less expensive. I hope that one day enough loyal customers will convince them that they were \"great\" like they were.
negative	 Corsair Hydro Series H115i Extreme Performance Liquid CPU Cooler, 280mm CW-9060027-WWPros: Bought this for my girlfriends PC running an FX 8350, the stock heat sink was super loud and would keep me up at night when she was gaming or doing work on it. This cooler makes the PC silent and cool, never saw temps over 35 C.Cons: After 4 months of use the pump died and overheated the PC causing it to shut down. Needless to say not very happy after having to remove the cooler and replace it with the stock one. Got lucky that none of the other components seem to be damaged.Other Thoughts: We have bought a lot of Corsair products in the past, cases, fans, memory, PSU, and this is the first one we have had problems with. 
negative	It is not a good game by downloading it you will waste your data. 
negative	Worst Dyson ever Dyson has ruined their product. Never buy this model or maybe any of their products again because they are making them cheap/poor. Also, you know your product is bad when the UPS store has a corporate account with Dyson for pre-made boxes for returns. 
negative	Why is it that when I registered my visa card, it automatically swipe payment in my visa card? It says I purchased something in Paypal? Am I right if you register your card, paypal will deduct fee from your card? If that so? Why I haven't read in the terms that I should pay a corresponding fee? I shouldn't have register my visa card then. Please fix this 
negative	It was a great stay for a budget hotel. Great value. No frills. Housekeeping and linen can be improved. Property could be updated but acceptable as is. I've stayed here several times for years and for years the elevator has not worked. There are only 3 floors and I don't mind the stairs which are kept clean and in good repair and well lit. I wanted a place to get away and at the same time be close to the ocean and parks and take care of business and it was perfect for that. It can be noisy on weekends.
negative	The app crashes every single time I try to upload something from the camera roll. This is infuriating. There is absolutely no reason for this! This app has always ran awfully, and with every update it's becoming more and more unusable. There is NO reason for this app to run this badly. 
negative	Game is way expensive if u wanna try to,play long term. Players leave game on all day so u can't attack them. Fun concept and fun when u can actually play. My advice, find a different game to invest In! They want u to constantly pay 50 to 100 dollars to get coins etc to upgrade and the upgrades don't do much. Crazy. This is the only post I've ever made. If u have a lot of money to waste then fine. But u will find that u have to spend an obscene amount of money on this one. Cheaper to go PS4! 
negative	This app is nothing more than a few pictures, that you have to copy with Microsoft's "snip" tool, and save it to a file, yourself, then paste it or upload it to wherever you'd like. You can not write onto the card, to personalize it, in anyway.
negative	I bought a monthly subscription with a free 1 week trial and now after one week it says that I need to buy it again. Upon restoring purchase, it says a problem with your purchase? Are you trying to fool people and fleece them by making them pay double? Good way to fool people. I would give zero stars if I could. 
negative	This guy that made this should do his homework. What a piece of junk program.
