positive	This is the most expensive formula but it works extremely well for my now six month old daughter. Her spitting up is almost non existent. I wish I could find it in a bigger size or more reasonable price.
positive	I have used many "tube" players before, but this one by far is the best. Not only the dark theme interface is awesome, it won't filter mature contents like other player. Please keep up the good job.
positive	This is the first year I've purchased slippers with arch support , and I wish I had done it sooner. I work at home and tend to be on my feet a lot, so I probably spend more time in these than any other shoes I own, at least during the winter. The arch support is perfect, and the cork sole helps keep my feet warm. Happy feet.
positive	Craig Pribyl is hands down the best loan officer I have dealt with! I mortgage shopped a few places, had some troubles, and then Craig got involved. From the minute he took me on as a client, everything was smooth and easy. Once Craig got me pre-approved, his assistant Linda Isek helped direct me on everything I needed to gather to meet my conditions. These two are ab solutely amazing. 5 stars is not a high enough score. I wish I could rate them even higher and I cannot say enough great things about them. Thank you both so much for getting me into my new home!!! ... Read More
positive	Love it!! Quick and easy and very relaxing and fun!!! Love it.
positive	Reserve your seats in advance then sit comfortably and enjoy a couple of authentic cocktails. Great venue for pre-dinner meet-up, grown-up drinks, strong with depth of flavour (no pre-made syrups or sugar overloads here). Yes, a good place.
positive	It has all the features that I need to keep track of my homework. Love the fact that I could sync and pair it with an app on my phone as well! If you're looking for something simple and organized to use, myHomework is a great application.
positive	Great phone. This is a great purchase if you want a phone that you can take to any carrier. My daughter uses it with MetroPCS and hasn't had any trouble with it. The guy at the Metro store was able to activate it without any issues. 
positive	Wow!. Wow! What a phone! Such speed! Much phone! Such camera! 
positive	I don't like having the option to not like or dislike songs that are being played by live radio stations being blocked.
positive	Love that these wipes are so easy on my son's skin. The only thing I would complain about is I wish they were a little stronger. They stretch when pulled out of the container and it sometimes makes things a little more difficult. Otherwise, I love them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	Simple and easy to use. Using the app allows you to avoid waiting in line to use the kiosks. You still have to wait in line to see an officer. The app is easy to set up and easy to fill out. I usually do it while walking to immigration from the plane. 
positive	Kindle is #1 I have been a Kindle owner, since they first came out. My wife bought me one for Christmas quite a while ago. I kept upgrading them as they came out, My new one is a Kindle fire 10.1. I am not sure what is next for Kindle, but I will stay on top of them. 
positive	This one is the easies one I have used, and I like you can different templates, pick frames and the colors you want. I have enjoyed it so much.
positive	I like it , I do wish their was more instruction in applying it ones work .
positive	Pampers offers so many different types of diapers, and if anyone has a baby with a sensitive bun like my kid-- they can relate to what a relief it was to find a diaper as comfortable yet durable as this diaper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
positive	I absolutely love this photo editor is works so well and leaves photos looking finished and proper
positive	I like the fact that I can keep my information private. Next, I don't have to carry around or search for a Passcode note book, papers everything in one place. Even if your place foes on fire, your Passcodes are safe that makes sense. I wish they had an address book vault that would be something everyone could use so that people don't loose track of family members.
positive	Excellent buy. Easy to use. Great camera, tons of apps and storage. Battery lost all day and then some. 
positive	I used to wear Mens 44s till the sole cracked, but Dansko have apparently changed their sizing. 4 returns later, and I'm still trying to dial it in. When they actually fit, they're phenomenal for the OR I'd also recommend: Ariat
positive	Rate: 5 stars -I have never been so excited about working out before! I actually get to punch & kick things!!! I have less stress which is awesome. All of my body does hurt but in the BEST way!!! I have never covered so many muscle groups in one work out before. The BEST thing of all is that they actually modified a routine just for me! #FitFam #Fitness #Progress #AustinFit #AustinTX #ATX #ILKBATX #ILKBAUSTIN
positive	App usability. I have several Roku devices in my home. In a family with six kids somehow the remotes go missing from time to time, so having this app gives me the same features basically without having to worry where my remote is! 
positive	This is the first pair of clogs I have ever owned, due to the fact that I'm a woman with long, slender feet. I ordered the narrow size and they seem to be ok, but still seem a bit wide. It's hard to compare (since these are my first clogs ) but after working 16 hours in them yesterday my feet feel fine. I did also notice that they seem to help me keep better posture.
positive	Air bnb. I always enjoy our trips the app is amazingly easy I've never had an issue highly recommend it 
positive	I purchased the fuscia boots for my niece for Christmas. She adored them and says they feel very comfortable. I am happy that I bought these beauties! Absolutely love them!
positive	This vacuum is amazing! We have tile through out our entire house ... This vacuum is amazing! We have tile through out our entire house and a cat, so this thing is fantastic. I also love being able to lift it away and the wand part is so helpful when cleaning the ceiling fans. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a new vacuum. I thought the price was reasonable and it works very well. 
positive	The hotel itself is very good. But the location and the noise level from the street are not. It says it all when you see an ambient noise generating machine and ear plugs in the room. Hotel located in a regenerating area (NE) and I do not feel as safe as in the NW.
positive	Five Stars Best one yet -highly recommended 
positive	I love Maxwell House decaf coffee because it tastes smooth, with no bitterness. My local Walmart quit stocking it, but I can still order it for the same price I paid when they stocked it.
positive	Its a good game but I wish that they could've have more ... Its a good game but I wish that they could've have more pokemon that what was given to us. Overall the theme of the game was fantastic. 
positive	I've used the Keeper App for several years. Works great, easy to use, syncs seamlessly across my computer, phone, ipad. Highly recommend.
positive	Dryer Brackets. Worked perfectly. Use as instructed and Dryer unit is stable on top of Washer. 
positive	Good but need a dark mode and account settings feature!
positive	my first time ordering these from Zappos, i usually buy these in person to make sure i dont have scuffes boots or an ashy black . Took a risk and ordered these on a late saturday night & received them early monday. and they were PERFECT . I ordered a bunch more things lastnight ! Thanks Zappos
positive	Roku is only good if you know exactly what you want to watch Faster than firestick and though it's the Amazon menu but at least it has one, Roku is only good if you know exactly what you want to watch, or use Fandango and though Apple TV has the TV feature no one seems to be signing on and it doesn't support UHD so after trying Apple TV 4th gen , Roku Ultra and Premium fire TV is the best overall 
positive	Love that it's always at my fingertips. If I'm out on the road, I still have my notes with me. Makes my job and everyday life, much easier to manage. Very pleased!
positive	Great app. Only $1.50 for pro and it will change your background everyday with a new pic. Only wish you could view pics in app fullscreen.
positive	I was told recently at a Levi's store that the 513 was being discontinued. I was disappointed to hear this, because these jeans have always been great for me. Have 2 pairs in different colors and really like the slim but not too slim feel of them. Combined with the slight stretch, they're a very comfortable every day pair of jeans for me. Hope to buy a few more pairs before they're discontinued for good.
positive	OMG I love this shoe. Fit true too size. Goes great with jeans , leggings, shorts , joggers. I love my timberlands
positive	Love the colors, the choice if pictures & saving them is great.
positive	Rate: 5 stars -It's really ok, I didn't have any problem with order, but I think that paying on this side is quite inconvinient.
positive	Rate: 5 stars -Polite and helpful and can't even tell you how nice he is and he helped me too much until I start thinking that no one will help me like him
positive	Easy to use, great cheap storage. After switching to a laptop with a smaller drive, found this unit indispensable giving me the additional storage space I needed for files I infrequently use 
positive	No instructions on how it work but easy enough once you figure out the program!
positive	Stayed last year, returned this year with friends. They were bowled over by the place, style, food, ambiance, service and quality of staff. We thought it was superb last year but enjoyed it ever more this year. Errol and Rita were stand out stars in a friendly, well trained and attentive staff. We'll be back next year without doubt.
positive	Well worth the price! Confession timeâ€¦ I am one of those selfish people who ravenously reads reviews before making any purchases, yet I rarely leave reviews myself. But I have to leave a review for this item! It is the greatest thing since sliced bread! We just moved into a new home that has dark walnut floors. Unfortunately my sweet dog has very light blonde hair and sheds horribly! I was pulling out my big vacuum every day to clean up the dog hair. I was so afraid that I was going to scratch the floor while using the big vacuum. After reading so many positive reviews I decided to take the jump and buy a Dyson. I am so glad I did! The Dyson V8 is not only super easy to use for daily messes, it is also very gentle on wood floors! And it has so much power! It does a better job cleaning up than my full-size Shark vacuum did. I have not regretted for a moment spending the money on the Dyson V8 Absolute! 
positive	works great. gives wonderfull full light where regular flash gives to much or bad reflections, like museums etc. 
positive	Convenient way to make extra cash. Works fine especially at wifi hotspots. This app provides simple way to earn extra gift cards for things people are shopping for anyway. Make sure to customize the app by selecting the "hearts" for your favorite stores that you'll be shopping at anyway - and then start earning those extra swagbucks 
positive	Great blu ray. Great features, love the apps and the remote is simple 
positive	It's FastThis. This is my 2nd drive. I'm using it as a mirror drive backup to my main drive. It works well. 
positive	I love this tv. It has a great picture and a full functioning tv remote in place of having to download an app on your phone to setup your tv.
positive	Much better than a video game! A classic game my kids love! 
positive	Great TV. My first big screen TV was a Samsung because in comparison to the other brands, Samsung has an outstanding picture. So this Samsung is my second one and it is as good as the first one with a much lower price than I paid several years ago. Will buy nothing but Samsung TV's. 
positive	Excellent. Love my new tv. It's so amazing and clear. Definitely great quality 
positive	Great TV. I bought this TV after seeing my sister had bought the curved 8500 series , and I just loved the picture and clarity of hers and that's when I had to go to Best Buy and make a purchase of my own which this 8000 was on sale and I don't regret making his purchase I can see myself keeping this for atleast the next five years , I highly recommend this tv to anyone , great features when you add some wifi to it !! Don't contemplate on this purchase just do it !! 
positive	Excellent. The amount of times I've used Shazam is more likely than not in the hundreds, and of those attempts, I can confidently say that the number of times Shazam has failed me is in the single digits. This app is superb. On top of it's effectiveness at identifying songs, the fact that once I identify a track I can seamlessly locate it within the Apple Music library and add it to my own library with a single tap is exemplary. A state of the art app. I have nothing but good things to say about this app. Bravo. 
positive	We took a spontaneous weekend trip out to The Original Hut Company from London as we were in desperate need of some countryside fresh air and greenery - it was the perfect decision. Anna and Nick are lovely, welcoming hosts and what they've created is wonderful. Our shepherd hut was excellently kitted-out and very cosy and comfortable in the evenings (we were glamping in December!) The setting is lovely and we enjoyed discovering the surrounding countryside on foot (with a more than a few stops at the lovely traditional pubs en route). The food provided in the Hub is also top notch and good value.Highly recommended.
positive	Worth the few $ . Cheap protection plan. 
positive	This app is quick and easy to use and helps keep up with expenses. Would recommend it.
positive	Great phone. Love the phone. Great technology, amazing picture quality. 
positive	Rate: 5 stars -Mark addressed all of my issues in one simple interface. The chat window for help is an awesome feature. I don't have time to sit on the phone and talk things through, or wait on hold. By having the chat feature I'm able to put in my request and when they get done, I get my response. They solved three issues (two caused by me) in one chat window!! Keep it up guys!
positive	Can't believe I like am app this much. I've found many apps just sooner live up to their promises. Either they're too busy with adds, sooner work, or, most important, they add no value. Not here. Hotel tonight offers an easy-to-use, intuitive platform, wide array of gorgeous, and costs that are in line with all online travel websites â€” over actuality found their Quote: d process to be less expressive. I love this app! 
positive	i have this app on my phone and it's great. As long as the picture you got is clear, the app will be able to read all the lines correctly. Misses some of the words but forgiven for that. :D Kudos to the developers. continue on developing quick and sleek apps.
positive	I like this one was much easier than the other I have. The sound is really good. What I don't like is that if we can pick our own music, we should be able to get from any music player online instead of trying to get it from my own files.
positive	Great Keyboard. My wrists were hurting using a regular keyboard and then after about two weeks of using his they have stopped hurting. 
positive	awesome. They have been awesome earphones I really am satisfied with the sound 
positive	Five Stars It was a gift and very well liked. 
positive	Easy to install. This was the easiest wall mount to install! Great product 
positive	great watch for beginner. awesome watch has everything i need in just a touch 
positive	I love this app. It is very useful. I use it daily for to do lists and copy notes and images to share between my devices.
positive	My son has good very bad we try different formulas cereals and nothing worked . Then my doctor had me try AR and it is amazing ! It literally cut his bit up in half !!!
positive	Catch phrase Great game and excellent service 
positive	Good for price.. This is good for a price. I just bought this so will se how it works 
positive	This is a great TV wall mounting bracket. There is not much to say about it. It is sturdy and easy to mount to the wall. It holds my 48" TV very stable and secure. The TV is easily mount and dismount from the wall bracket. I don't see how it could possibly be accidentally knocked off of the wall mounting bracket either. A very sturdy and practical wall mounting bracket for flat screen TVs. 
positive	great machine. My wife loves this machine and so do i because its so quiet 
positive	When I first had my son I had complications with breastfeeding. We tried many other formulas before switching to this one. They all had the same affect on him but this wonder made him a complete different child.
positive	Easy to work, with many list choices, like notes, grocery list, appointments, etc.
positive	I love it. Right size for me and can take ... I love it. Right size for me and can take it with me with no problems. Faster to read my email then laptop. Only thing negative is that the battery doesn't stay charged and drains even when I'm not using it. 
positive	Great if you do not have a smart TV yet. I just started using this to access apps for series and movies-there's so much on here it takes a while to navigate everything-use the Alexa voice control to just ask for what you want to access 
positive	This is a great app that makes it easy to make notes from PDF, web pages etc. and not have to reach for a paper pad/pen. I can then cut and paste or do the action I was planning example make a phone call. Its good way to GTD
positive	I absolutely love these boots . They are a timeless classic that will never go out of style and they fit well.
negative	I tried to register, it crashed, I gave up and started playing, it crashed. So I reinstalled, it gets to the loading screen and crashes, plez help. It was such a good game the 5 minutes I got to play. 
negative	Used to work great. After performing a recover, I can't get the app to activate. Frustrating. 
negative	With the latest update this app has become unusable! It won't correctly track my location and is wildly inaccurate when suggesting routes. Whatever you did with the latest update, please undo it! 
negative	Actually make a decent app for android don't be lazy! make a decent app for iPhone and android! Code a decent app for android. don't make it just screenshot the android viewfinder! we have better cameras then iPhone's yet ours look worse! 
negative	Since I updated the app it will not give me the bus routes that I need it only gives me the bus routes for Sunday 
negative	Ugh...just work This is the second Fire TV I've had in about two years. I was hesitant to buy another after the first one went kaput, but I relented. This second is even worse than the first. About every third time I use the device, I have to unplug and replug the power cable on the device to get it to work For $90, this device should not have a basic power issue. 
negative	*** This review may contain spoilers *** SPOILERS Octopus as aliens!! REALLY !!!! - my grand daughter could have drawn more convincing and frightening aliens than the highly paid special effects bods did for the making of this B movie. Oh, and the space craft - truly pathetic. Honestly, 1960's science fiction films are just as well done with better story lines, more suspenseful and eminently more watchable. The story was laborious, uninteresting and overly complicated. This was a film that so desperately needed kick starting but it's engine just would not fire up. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, the hype pre-launch offered such promise but what a deception that was. I now feel cheated. 8.3 - where on earth has that come from, you only have to skip through the reviews to see that this rating is impossible. Complete pretentious RUBBISH.
negative	T much ads. This app transformed my phone into an AD DISPLAYER. Ads everywhere . Even the lockscreen. This amount of ads can also ruin your data plans.So better be careful if you are very limited 
negative	The room was very small and overlooked an inside courtyard which had machinery of the hotel. Not very good. This room was not on the images at hotel.com. Very misleading. There also was no option for an upgrade at hotels.com. If you need to go to this hotel you must stay at one of the better rooms, otherwise you can do much better somewhere else. They also charged me $55.00 to keep my car overnight.
negative	I really enjoyed this app and download a lot videos but now is broken. what happened to this video??? I download the videos and it won't download no videos at all. This app won't download videos anymore. This app is for window 8.1 and this app don't work on window 10. You need to fix this app and update it and make it work for window 10. I'm going to have to uninstalled this app for now until you fix this app. Please fix this app and bring it back but make sure it works for window 10. hope you can fix this.
negative	IT IS HORRIBLE I HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME WHILE IT'S SEARCHING FOR PLAYERS ðŸ˜± 
negative	This game sucks. If I could I would rate it I 0star. Just hate it. Can't play only and only because of to many ads. This game is just waste of time. I suggest not to download it. Just sucksðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ðŸ˜¾ 
negative	Worthless!. Seriously unbelievably horrid considering it's Virgin Atlantic. Although their mobile website is crap too.I apparently put in the wrong password ONCE. It said I had exceeded the number of tries???But it allowed me, in fact, took me straight to my upcoming booking!I was interested in upgrading. It tells you the price ranges from $10 to $2500....why bother mentioning it?? But there's no way to actually check what it is or order it.Fine, I'll stay in economy, and next time I'll take a different airline and erase this stupid, worthless app.Need a ZERO star! 
negative	Can you make three emoji stickers in the form of OUR phone's emojis? Not the Apple ones that end up looking like crap. Also this is lagging a lot. You need to do as good a job with Android users as you do Apple users. 
negative	Can't download satellite images any more. Can't search for 4wd tracks by name. No Billy Goat, Ellis, Blowhard, Cockpit, Not Much Help, Aeroplane, etc. What is the point of a search function if you can't find the 4wd tracks? Hopeless. Google maps knows where I am better than this app. Terrible in Vic. 
negative	Obtuse App. As a big Lego fan I was curious about the app, sadly it's hardly user friendly-I had trouble uploading my pictures, when you do you can't adjust the size or orientation of them, all my photos were rejected by the mod without giving me a reason, in trying to change my name I ended up deleting my Lego VIP account almost losing $50 worth of points I'd saved up. If the rest of it was intriguing enough I'd keep trying to use it but it seems like a barely passable instagram clone. 
negative	It was so bad it was just frezzing in the middle of the game so stop triying!cause your game sucks I rqte it a negative 0. 
negative	Stupid update unnerf heart of midas you stupid idiots they fucked up they lost a customer here 
negative	If ony I could rate it a zero!. I had the TWC app and it wasn't perfect, but it worked. Now they update to this app and I get a waiting black screen, then a message that something's wrong, try again later. They updated it a day after, so I thought they'd fixed the glitch. Nope. SSDD.If this is a portent, I am ready to cut the cable. It is ridiculous for a nationwide company to be this inept -- *especially* at the rates they charge. Now I'm worried about how they will screw around with my online access. TWC has been the best, IMHO, for a cable connection here in Hawaii, but maybe that isn't true anymore. 
negative	This game is NOT free to play. In the newest event you can participate as a f2p player. This is a weekend long event that free players cannot advance beyond the lowest level. Scopely knows it is unfair to the f2p player and does not care. If you are looking for a balanced f2p/p2p experience look elsewhere. 
negative	This is Bullsh1t! I should NOT have to PAY to trim a f*cking video 
negative	I've been using the radiant tampons since they first came out with no issues until now. Just bought a new box tonight and the grip has changed. It's terrible!!! The previous one was tapered all the way around so it was very to easy to grip while pressing the plunger. The new one is narrow and flat, can barely hold onto it during insertion. What a nightmare. These will not work for me and I will need to find a new product that is easier to use. It's very disappointing. I've been using Tampax for 25 years and as a pharmacist I've never hesitated to recommend their products...until now.
negative	Used to like this game, but not anymore. Purchased a new tablet, and everything I worked so hard for is now completely gone. Have to start all over again. WHAT A RIPP-OFF! 
negative	Updated App Still Doesn't Work. Update! Broken forever. Still cannot connect even after all of the updates. It's ridiculous Vizio has hundreds of thousand TVs out there that cannot be controlled because their app is worthless, if this is a feature that is required to run an entertainment center then it should work. Now I understand why the TVs come at such a great value but they still need to provide what is advertised and what basically controls every aspect of your TVs picture, settings and so on. I have been a fan of Vizio for years but this is making me disappointed in their brand. Fix all of the issues people have been having, make sure it works then update. 
negative	*** This review may contain spoilers *** CONTAINS SPOILERS This film looks good, very clever, good acting. However the message...a woman should just take up with any man she meets, knowing nothing about him...if it goes bad then it's because men are pigs...your only hope is that by going from one to another you will finally chance upon a good one and live happily ever after. Having got that off my chest....let me say the London settings are very cool, the acting, especially Ms Paltrow's, is very good, the concept of parallel, alternative story lines is well presented, without having to explain that to viewers. I enjoyed watching it but as its POV of helpless woman became more and more clear my enjoyment went way down.
negative	Very bad. Alot to improve. My Real time spot on Google map is different from where I am actually standing 
negative	Terrible!!!. Do not get this app. It's possible they are just phishing for photos because they get access to your photos. Load of crap. It kept saying it needed more photos and did not do anything. It did not lead you to where it's supposed to swap photos. It just wants you to buy full version. Crap! Crap! Crap! 
negative	Greedy developer and company. U won't be able to play after a while bcos u need to buy everything which is needed to complete missions. Just don't waste ur time in this 
negative	Game is really good. But is lacking in quality events for end game. Instead of improving on the Japan version of events, we get new ones that have one boss and are gimmicks. Christmas and new years were horrible. And now we have Ariana Grande for our next event? What does some teen pop star have to do with Final Fantasy? this game has the potential to be great if they just gave us a nice stream of Dungeons and trial bosses 
negative	Uterly nothing like the description above 
negative	i tap open then after 2 second, evil factory has stopped 
negative	Enjoyed the breakfast and the friendliness if staff!! RJ was very helpful and accommodating. Great ambiance!!!
negative	Stole my money and its been weeks to get my gems still nothing and i submited two emails to get them. 
negative	garbage game ... i played for 23 mins to collect 150.000 and after unlocking the new game ... i played 32 rounds at 4000 and never won 1 coin ... im uninstall it ... 
negative	I thought this was going to be good. But I can't name my own categories or change from Â£ to $ disappointed 
negative	Useless. Installed it on multiple devices and ran it off numerous networks, and every time it displays an error and shuts down. 
negative	With the new update, the hand of midas is really useless now. Midas is a really helpfull skill to advance stages but such a trash now. Please bring back the old Midas. 
negative	Extremely disappointed! Bought this in February, by October the drive failed on me. Extremely disappointed! 
negative	Was a great game, but after this update the hand of midas is way to nerfed, and the event Burton is blocking for chain with hero's extra attack. Just move the button and undo the nerf and you'll be back up to 5 stars 
negative	I seldom write a review for anything but Snapchat used to be awesome as long as there were no ads in it. After forcing the ads upon us, it isn't likeable anymore as it used to be. Just adds up to battery drain as well as data wastage for whatever ads are being forced upon us. 
negative	It won't even let me play it comes up as GB it said you must have 3.3GB and I pressed one and it didn't work I deleted all my games for this 
negative	I can't imagine any reason why this app (for kids) would need to access my photos, files, contacts or require the ability to make and manage phonecalls on my device. I have deleted it. 
negative	This is a a joke.i don't believe thid. Total Rip-offðŸ˜  
negative	This is getting me angry. I spend money on this game if this is not fix by april 27 i will take legal action. FIX IT! 
negative	Player retention is -NOT- their top priority. DO NOT SPEND ANYTHING in this game, it's not worth it because you will eventually quit. The current event (AForce) has a lot of underhanded tricks and low blows from the devs, last minute changes, and unbalanced scaling with event items. 
negative	scam don't waste your money. they say they increase drop rates so you spend $$ let me just say 40k in gems and still haven't received a good drop 
negative	16.000 us dollars to get the VIP 15 title and benefits. Great graphics however this game could be a waste of money. Without paying you're unable to strengthen your character at an equal pace to the VIP's, not worth download 
negative	One Star Based on the fact that the display is messed up on a brand new item 
negative	So horrible I wanna kill myself whoever wants to download it don't it is dumb 
negative	Junk! I'd give it a zero stars if I could! Just got this product today. My son played with it for two minutes and one of the yellow squares broke off! 
negative	Jeff the killer I want you dead in five minutes 
negative	From the results, I see this test is based on the MBTI personality type test. I am a solid INFJ, yet it typed me as INFP. I took it again, making sure to really consider and understand each question. It came up with ISFJ. Just go to 16personalities website or pay $50 for the actual MBTI test.
negative	Data and wifi needed for accumulated gold, pets, and daily rewards which is crappy 
negative	Not worth it at all I'm so disappointed in this game. I played it with my son. It basically went off every other turn. It was soooo not very random so we knew who was getting the pie in the face. Waste of money for 5 minutes of amusement. 
negative	crashing unexpectedly, and even IF both those were fixed, the 'checking for connection' issue is a headache. (I paid for it am sick of having to be near wifi to play it, as with all games square sh!ts out now, the whole reason I GET the games is so I have something to do when NOT near net.) If I was able, I'd happily get a refund for all of the games I paid square cash for, and just go pirate them, and have fully functional games that do NOT need net connection. Please learn from this square, your only encouraging people to 'get them free!' Also, where is controller support(Nvidia controller specifically)? 
negative	I could not use this app because ads popped up again as soon as I closed the last one. I could NOT even select an option for search. I have reported it to Microsoft and demand it be removed from Windows app store.
negative	Keeps force closing when I reach the menu. 
negative	Paid for the old app. Now they are making us pay for the new one. I think it is only fair that you revive the old app for those who previously paid for it 
negative	Its pure crap! Poor picture quality & less than very few hairstyles. 
negative	Will Try Again So far I am not impressed. I setup the Ooma device and after trying a few different setup configuartions it was ready to go. I attempted to make a phone call and received a phone number not in service message. Odd that number was to my cell phone. Then the unit stopped working. I will replace the Ooma and try again. Side note and a good sign, the customer service is very responsive helpful. 
negative	Awful. It has covers not the real artistðŸ‘Ž 
negative	I like that it is easy to figure out how to use. I don't like having to scroll so much to go through the colors. Can they be made smaller so that more can fit in a smaller space.
negative	Cheaters not send pin code number only deduct the amount tell me what it is Liars 
negative	I'm sorry to say, but the app isn't resizing to a phone screen, rendering the app useless for phone users :/ ... not to mention that it doesn't really fit very well on a computer screen either :/
negative	I ordered this for Christmas. What I received was French vanilla cappuccino. I tried to get it corrected but was given the run around. I may try to order it again later.
negative	Where has the 'most recent' Gone? I don't want to see what's happened from 2 days ago. I want to see the most recent posts. FB have slowly moved it deeper within the app until this time when I have to click 5 buttons to be able to click 'most recent' And then it only shows about 5 posts before reverting back to 'most popular'. This doesn't happen on my ipad where most recent is within my favourites and easily click able and it works. Why can't fb actually give me what I want? 
negative	Missing pieces Missing pieces to this game. 
negative	Played this for quite some time. Got to the best bike with all the top end features. Still see people blowing me away on straight aways. Jumping twice as far, at what point will the dev admit they've got a major hacking problem? 
negative	This is a load of cr-app .Either links not working or adds on a loop most of the time .I would give it a - 4.8.... I wasted my time installing,dont do the same. UNINSTALLING! 
negative	your update completely ruined the app! it used to recognize your playing speed and the keys would come down accordingly, but now they just rush to the bottom no matter how fast you play, the app even tells me to go faster when it's completely unnecessary. jesus christ guys you f****ed up a perfectly good system, fix it!!! 
negative	I still cannot play, keeps saying error occured 11:GS.. says that on my samsung tab 3 and samsung S4 and iphone 6S please fix in next update!!! 
negative	You guys are trying too hard To copy the real subway surfers. 
negative	Ads pop up in the middle of the game, causing you to lose 
negative	I have a Office365 enterprise account and am unable to login to the app.
negative	Hated it s FRICKIN MUCH UGH TIS IS SO STUPID MY FEET ARE SWEATING BECAUSE OF THIS BULL PS IT SUCKED NUTS 
negative	I've spent 2 days of my life trying to get this to operate the way it says it will. The manual is the worst. I have 15 emails and different downloads and a couple hours with tech support. I'm now returning it because it won't work as stated. Wish I hadn't wasted 2 days of my life.
negative	U can make JUST 5 ringtones....then u have to buy this app p
negative	This is a poor imitation of bad programming from the 1980s. Dont bother with this app
negative	Worst app videos are fake we cant make any paper crafts just waste of time and energy. 
negative	This game is really pissing me off..it doesn't want to load up or freezes. Today I log in and it takes away over 1700 BB and I lose over 2000 coins..I would like them back please. 
negative	Really, really poor product. Since purchasing this drive, it's corrupted itself twice. On top of that, as a personal gripe, it's stupidly hard trying to open and close the slide protector on it. Opening the drive forces you to push hard enough to hurt your thumb, and pulling it to close is nigh impossible (which is only a slight exaggeration).Seriously though, it's corrupted twice on me, and this is out of three separate occasions of me plugging it into my laptop to use data stored on it. 2/3 times it's needed me to wipe and repair it due to "errors". 
negative	Snapchat isn't allowing me to login from my phone but when I tried from another phone, it logs in and works perfectly. Please fix it. It used to work before but now I can't login. 
negative	Cannot believe I paid for the previous app, had it for years problem free, and now I've got to pay a big price to keep it now. Disgraceful you should be ashamed money grabbing goons. Lots of comments I've seen all feel the same way too!!! 
negative	I really wanted to like this keyboard. It arrived with three sticky keys. I thought that this was an isolated incident but it appears from other reviews that this is the norm for this keyboard. It really is a shame, its built like a tank and has a weight to match. Fatar dont appear to have much in the way of quality control and that is terrible considering how much this midi controller costs. 
negative	This was a let down. Horrible do not download 
negative	Controls are awkward,gameplay is slow and grindy and there is a time limit on how many times you can play a level. 
negative	Sampling bias. 9 out of 10 bad experiences are rejected while 100% of positive experiences are approved. This is why almost every hotel has a 5 star rating on trip advisor. So regardless of if you're checking up on Category 5 Ritz or a bed bug infested motel in middle of nowhere town, you'll only see happy people checking in with 4 or 5 stars. This site gives you ZERO USEFUL INFORMATION. Too bad. Maybe there is a conflict of interest with them trying to sell hotel rooms while they moderate reviews for the very same hotels. I took my $30k annual vacation budget and made sure trip advisor and it's affiliate such as Expedia doesn't get a penny. 
negative	I had this app on my phone before and used it for one awesome batch of photos. I loved the service but this 1 star rating is for this windows app. Will not let me sign in to my Free Prints account before the sign in window quickly disappears. Absolutely frustrating and a waste of 20 minutes.
