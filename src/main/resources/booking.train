positive	We really appreciated the hospitality of the owner he was very helpful with arrangements of car rentals,beach supplies and some extras The property is clean quiet comfortable has a lot of greens Great location close to superfood and beaches
positive	Very warm and friendly welcome. My room was spacious, very cosy and decorated with taste. Beautiful view on the ocean. Definitely a highly recommended adress
positive	The rooms were simple, yet clean and comfortable. For the price, this is the best accommodation that you are likely to get in Uluwatu (which turned out to be a pricey region). The staff was extremely helpful and flexible. For a very modest sum, we were allowed to stay in our room until our flight departed (at night). Also the owners enabled us to print some documents, free of charge.
positive	Couldn't fault it!The whole experience was very excellent, the manager was very helpful. Definetly value for money. I would highly recommend this motel for a pleasant & blissful stay.
positive	Out the way if your not fit, would need a carFriendy owners and staff
positive	Can't even say how much We thank you for everything. We really enjoyed our stay and the breakfast was great. Wasn't so easy to find your place but definitely worth to find :) Thank you once again and We hope to see you soon in Switz :)
positive	Apartment 106 is a bit low in the building, therefore, outside views are not greatThe apartment is fully kitted, including a washing machine, satellite TV and DVD player. Feels like a home away from home.
positive	Nicely decorated room. Great breakfast with fresh fruit salad. Engaged staff, Mohamed provided us with some great travel advice.
positive	A bit far from center of the city.Clean and luxury.
positive	Maybe just breakfast could be more variable :)The staff was very helpful, they took care of our luggage - very trustful and safe place.
positive	Nothing.Friendly & corroborative staff. The location was near my work in Reem Island. Quite & comforting place. Its Clean. The nice offer I got from Booking.com ... it was a real bargain.
positive	The hotel is right beside a large lot that is used for out door festivals. They only had parties for 3 nights out of the two weeks, but they went on until 4:00 am and I could not get any sleep.The staff was friendly and the bed was comfortable. Lots of restaurants and supermarkets in walking distance. Great WiFi.had hot water. Air conditioner worked great.
positive	Towels could use an upgradeClose to everything, but on a quiet side street. Spacious rooms. Direct access to beach, and the pool is very nice, but bring your own beach towels.
positive	Room 313 looks out over a construction site where they're building a new wing, so not a great view. Also, it was not clear whether the chilled champagne in the room was complimentary (paid) or not (we assumed it was, but no price indicated anywhere).Good location on the way to town - tram 9 stops right in front. Nice breakfast. Comfortable bed and nice bathroom.
positive	It's really comfortable and good living experience, I will chose to live here again when next time in Kyoto.
positive	One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in due to the very helpful and friendly staff, the great location, the attention paid to details and guest comfort in the rooms and throughout the hotel. I chose not to rent a car; there is a charge for parking at the hotel.Exceptional staff and service. Outstanding one bedroom suite with full kitchen, fireplace, in-unit washer and dryer, and large outdoor patio. Immaculate. Salt water pool on roof heated for Winter. Perfect location downtown near sights, restaurants, services. Easy access to airport via direct train two short blocks from hotel. Waterfront within walking distance. Looking at the sea and snow covered mountains while standing amid skyscrapers a few blocks from the hotel. Beautiful.
positive	The lady who runs the guesthouse is very friendly and helpful. The first room I stayed in did not suit me and I asked if I could please be moved. They were very accommodating and I loved the second room I was moved to. Good location. I enjoyed the three varieties of breakfast. For dinner: try out Warung Lilla, which is just down the next road, great ambience and food.
positive	Lovely place in a central part of Anuradhapura, but still quiet - and especially lovely hosts! The guesthouse can provide a tuktuk-driver in no time, Poornima and her mother speak very good English and are extremely helpful. You can have great Sri Lankan food in a restaurant just a few minutes walk away.
positive	The Island is a real Party Island. The hotel is excellent.Lovely hotel. It's a real party Island, but when you sleep atthe Mama Beach Residence you will be in a relax mode. We loved the woman from the breakfast service. She is so nice, friendly. Everyday she came to the sunbeds to give us juice etc.
positive	The staff were amazing, so friendly and accommodating. Was extremely happy with our stay. Conveniently located next door to a supermarket which was handy since we have a baby. Will stay here again.
positive	One of my favorite hotels. I stayed in the premium club king room and the perks alone were worth the money. You really feel taken care of while at this hotel. Very clean and comfortable. I would absolutely stay again.
positive	Top bunks were squeakyEverything- thank you Javier for a lovely stay. Especially love the eggs and dulche de leche at breakfast :-)
positive	the fact that you must use the stairs to the reception is not very pleasant especially when you have a heavy luggagevery close to promenade des anglais, receptionits are very nice and helpful...
positive	No undercover parking meant ice scraping, and people smoking outside there rooms goes straight into your room. They need to relocate the ash trays. For $149 a night it was great value.location was great, they have a wax room, house-keeping staff were helpful, internet was great and free, and Patric helped wherever he could.
positive	Wi-fi had specific use limit before requiring a further slip of paper with new sign in details. 2.3 Kms from an evening town restaurant, if you don't want to driveExcellent location on a quiet beach road with great views. Owners were generally very helpful and loaned us beach towels. We could sit outside on 2 different patios, depending upon the time of day. Car was located by the room for easy loading.
positive	I didn't like a WiFi. It's so slow and not working very properly.I really like that hotel's really comfortable and the staff is nice. I also like the breakfast. It was really nice. I'll definitely recommend it to my friends!
positive	Location! Quiet little street close to city center! Just 20 min. walking distance! Clean. Good breakfast (include in the room rate). Highly recommended!
positive	The hotel is literally far away from the downtown, where all the attractions are located. 40 min drive and 65-100 dirhams.Great interior, food, very friendly staff
positive	Great breakfast, easy to get to town(the tram stops 100 m from the hotel - and goes directly to town), nice rooms and super comfy bed! I loved that the cleaning-ladies gave our little girl her own towel and a shower gel for kids, without us asking for anything - they had just observed that a kid stayed in that room<3 she looooved the soap!
positive	Satellite tv had serious problems--channels would freeze or lock up every few minutes, rendering the tv useless-lasted all 3 days I was there. Also, temperature control of shower water was either very, very hot or very cool. Completely indecipherable tablet driven room control pad, made turning lights on and off a very difficult proposition.Excellent free breakfast
positive	The room I had was quite small and very basic.Good location, very friendly staff, good breakfast. Good value for money.
positive	It is my second stay here and everything was as perfect as the first time. Swimming pool amazing, breakfast delicious, stuff friendly and helpful. I just wish to have a chance to come again.
positive	This was a great hotel. The staff - particularly Ravi - was very friendly and helpful. He gave us a lot of great advice about what to do in the city and then helped us arrange the next leg of our journey through Sri Lanka. The hotel breakfast was outstanding.
positive	Staff extremely kind and helpful. As in the room next to mine there were some works, they contacted me to change room immediately. A complimentary bottle of wine was provided in the new room.
positive	Nothing.Last minute booking, Easy late check in . Very helpful staff, no payment needed until check out. Free parking ($8/hr in town), many hotel charge $18-30/ day for parking. The owner even offered us to park our car there after checked out due to we wasn't sure if there was any car park in town to catch the cable car. He suggested us to leave car at the parking, short walk down hill to catch the cable car up and Walk down hill again back to hotel by go through beautiful botanical garden and unique street view.. Best choice ever. Room was a bit antique and old school, definitely love the old school shower handle and spa, and everything working beautiful.. Massive room compliment continental breakie.. Was delicious...
positive	The laundry room was too small for the size of the property. The nearby restaurant choice was limited, but I have a feeling that will change.The room was big with a decent view and I liked the edgy neighbourhood. The staffers for the most part were friendly efficient and helpful.We were very comfortable.
positive	My room was on the ground floor, opening off the central patio which I found a little noisy - particularly one evening when some other guests were shouting & jumping in the pool at 4am. If noise is a problem, ask for a room on a higher level.Excellent sized comfortable room, in an easily accessible location for all major tourist sights. Room was clean, with all the mod cons and an extra large bed which was great!
positive	I would say that hotel's address is not really correctly presented in bookingcom, because there's written Nevsky Prospekt 87/2, but in reality the entrance is from Goncharnaya str. 2. I think this information should be written in booking in the line where address is. The other thing is about computer which was in my room (lucky me, because I got upgrade :)) - it would be great to update computer's programmes and to check why it's working quite slowly.I was lucky to get a room upgrade (don't know what was the reason, but it doesn't matter as long as I got better room :)). I liked very much the size of shower cabin. I was staying only for 2 nights and unexpectedly my towels were changed after first night. Reception staff was very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was good, frankly I was expecting the food and choice of it to be more simple, so I'm glad I was wrong :)
positive	Furnishings and lay out of the room could use improvement. We had two full sized beds and a twin. We'd have preferred a King sized bed and a table and chairs. Though security was available for valuables, personal safes in the room would improve convenience.Ocean right out the door, pool very nice, ample patio area. The food and service in the restaurant were great and the prices too. Convenient location--right on the beach and close to the Malecon, taxis, buses, restaurants, shops. Individualized room air conditioning worked quietly and pefectly when we wanted it. Price reasonable, staff responsive and helpful.
positive	The hotel is looking its age - a little tired, but the rest of the experience more than made up for that.The staff were friendly and helpful. The dinner was excellent and the breakfast was all that you would want.
positive	Can be a bit hard to find initiallySuch a beautiful view! Val was really nice and accommodating. We got in a few hours early and she let us check in. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was good.
positive	Perfect location, friendly communication and all you need right on the spot.
positive	The cleaning stuff could be more careful, they took my cases from my bed, but still I had some nights to stay there. Afterwards, I asked the reception staff about them, they gave me all cases, and everything was OK.Actually, there is a lot to describe about this hostel. The staff is very good and helpful. You can choose a lot of trips in very reasonable prices. The main advantage is the restaurant inside the hostel. The food is very tasty, strating from the western breakfasts, from other western style food to chinese food. There is also a lot of good beers, and speciality - snake vodka.
positive	Can't find anything seriously I can't say anything bad aboutWhat did I like about the propriety? Everything! Great location in the middle of the wineries just across the street of the famous Trapiche, super friendly staff (family run) great food and wines, clean and beautiful restored property
positive	Breakfast was very basic needs improvement a wider selection Omelets were good Better quality bread needed and continental options cheese, cold meat, smoked salmon would improve the breakfastThe location proximity to the beach room opening up to pool
positive	The location of the hotel is great, just couple blocks away from the town center. The staff was very helpful and were always pending of our needs. For sure we´ll come back.
positive	NoneAmazing staff , best location ever , nice view , fastest wifi
positive	Information telling us that the family friendly restaurant was under renovation so we could make an alternative plan.Ambience of the hotel coupled with a comfortable room, fantastic swimming pool overlooking Abu Dhabi and excellent staff.
positive	Possibly the light in rooms could be a bit brighter or individual lamps provided for each bed. The breakfast could be a bit more customised because after a 10 day stay I had a bit of urgency to have something different.I loved the staff who were always extremely helpful and friendly. The bed was comfortable and the lounge was great. Area in which this Hostel is located is a huge bonus for tourists with many local shops which sell just about anything you can imagine.
positive	Only complaint I could think of was that wi-fi was a little slow in the room. But plenty good in lobby. It still worked though, better than some places. I would definitely stay here next time I'm in town.Breakfast was a nice surprise!! Didn't even know it was an option, but nice full spread in the morning.
positive	There is no hair drier on the second floor,after the shower I have to walk to another place to use it . The security is not really good.some one change my suitcase's code and I can't open it .terrible experience.nice location，good staff，great place，comfortable bed,clean room
positive	Gym Phone on the table (for business calls)Great professional and friendly staff Very Clean Good Breakfast Nice and comfortable room
positive	There was nothing not to likeI like the non smoking an smoking area. Food was great but cereals an bacon would of been nice our stay was very lovely an comfortable I would return again
positive	The hosts were wonderful and welcoming. They enriched our stay in Oaxaca.
positive	Keep an eye on the thermostat in the drying room, it kept getting turned down by someone.Great staff who go above and beyond to help and make the stay comfortable and enjoyable, Lee is a great bloke. Good facilities with an awesome on site onsen to relax in after a day on the slopes. Right in the action with many restaurants and bars right on your door step, will definitely come back.
positive	The bed was very firm. Also wished our fireplace in our room had more flame was more like embers burning.The staff was very attentive and available. Having the shuttle available to restaurants/etc from 4-11 was fantastic! Rooms were incredibly quiet. Never heard another guest on our floor or the elevator and we were right off the elevator.
positive	No welcome treats or special gifts to say welcome.Beds mattress is a bit hollow.
positive	The glass in our front window was broken. The lounge furniture was Lx and stained. My friends room located nearer the road was very noisy.It was very spacious and well equipped. We liked the paper towels instead of tea towels/ hand towels. This more hygienic.
positive	Could hear some quite loud bass heavy music from a nearby bar(?) but it finished by around midnight.Great value for money and very helpful and friendly staff. Good location on the edge of the historic centre just a couple of blocks from the main square. Lots of choice of restaurants and bars in near vicinity.
positive	The add-ones like full bottles of wine and liquor as well as massages were a little expensive. I wouldn't recommend the VIP breakfast. Stay away from the Unlimited Vacation Club people at the Cancun Airport. It will be the same people at the resort. We liked the idea of it and purchased during our breakfast but saw so many bad reviews my wife started to cry and I went to see how to cancel it the next morning(which takes some real work) and ended up spending way too much time on our honeymoon doing things we didn't want to.The property advertised unlimited luxury and with your basic stay you did get that. The shows they did in the evenings were great and as the property gets a little more mature I think it will be worth another visit. This is not a property to visit expecting a wild crazy party - but you can go to Playa Carmen for a night and come back to relax again.
positive	I just missed another extra hammock (there was always someone and I really looked forward to it!) and maybe some hangers in the rooms and the toiletsVery nice and relaxed place where I could have stayed for a few more days if I had had the time! Very clean, nice staff, nice breakfast, nice common areas, nice kitchen facilities, good vibes!
positive	Diner was much better in previous time. Czech personnel in the hotel... only at desk.Desk staff.... really good, smile, helpful.. Perfect WiFi. Welcome bottle of sparkling wine is great idea.
positive	Internet is not so fast.Perfect location, good room and bed. Loved the breakfast. Very nice staff. Important: very safe neighborhood. Lots of surveillance. very close to the flee market, walking distance to Palermo Soho (nice walk by the way) all by all: prime value for money.I'll be back there.
positive	I liked the layout of this suite. It was simple but modern decorations made it very warm and inviting. Simone was very kind and generous,. We've already recommended people to stay there.
positive	Nothing to complainStaff is very helpful and friendly. Very good wifi. The place is quiet for relax. If you look for quiet and peaceful, 1Sabai is the answer.
positive	They could have had 2 ice machines, one by each elevator.Staff were friendly. Our room overlooked the pool and the pool area is beautiful. Great special on for breakfast during the week too.
positive	The location is great! Close to the shops and restaurants. Close to tairua summit and right in front of the beach! I love our room overlooking the beach, and the balcony as well. The room is very clean and they made the most of the space. I love the free use of kayaks and vests and bikes as well. We really enjoyed our time here :) highly recommend!!
positive	The doiuble bed was 2 single beds joined - the join was poor & uneven making the bed uncomfortableGood/helpfull staff experience, very good location, clean and good sized apartment with everything required
positive	The owner is absolutely amazing, taking good care and cooking delicious food. He helps organise whatever you need. The location is perfect, very close to the temple area.
positive	Hotel is right next to the Gondola on Happo one - biggest ski resort in valley. Staff were very accomodating and the saki bar upstairs is family friendly. Great place to stay
positive	Everything was goodGreat location for everything Prague .. Restaurants cinema main rail station trams and old city Charles bridge all in walking distance..Hotel quiet clean convenient and warm...
positive	We originally booked the triple with 3 twin beds. It had no windows and almost no room for anything except the beds, very dingy with little light, one could hardly navigate around the beds. It's very basic and just a place to sleep. Fernando was very nice to allow us to change over to the king bed suite and give us an extra bed at very little extra expense.Fernando was an amazing and kind host. Our suite with king size bed (Room #9) was spotlessly clean, comfortable and very large. It was a corner room with two exposures, large windows overlooking cobble stone streets en suite bathroom and the hotel was very near the zocalo (town square) and pedestrian street with great galleries, restaurants and weekend artisan crafts market.
positive	Pool really smallexcellent location, great breakfast
positive	There's noise coming from the shopping mall air conditioning units making it difficult for me to sleep without ear plugs.Room is very spacious and comfortable. Easy access to Al Wahda Mall.
positive	The painted room was awesome! They prepared delicous food!
positive	The breakfast every day is same and we hope can have something new is better.The staff is friendly and the room is very comfortable. The location is not in the center but there have the three metro lines.
positive	Friendly and very helpful staff. Very clean everywhere. Extremely comfortable bed and spacious room. Very good location. Not far from train station. Good breakfast. Great dinner and service
positive	The pool water was ok in temperature, but the air was so cold that we were freezing as soon as we get out of water. Room a little small for a king size bed.The staff was great and prompt to answer our questions.
positive	Tony was very pleasant on our arrival to the motel on Saturday.
positive	Personal touch and interaction with hotel owners who were very helpful in giving us advice to get around Good bed, clean room Location away from downtown and Marina, but in walking distance Rooftop terrace
positive	Beautiful setting in a old colonial building. Good value and excellent location.
positive	Gym was a bit datedAmazing location and excellent rooms
positive	Scrambled eggs for breakfast, comfortable dorms with air con, very clean, very helpful staff, excellent facilities.
positive	Due to a booking mixup, we were given an interior room first which was very drab and musty. Situation was quickly corrected and we a nice big room with balcony for the other 3 nights.Excellent El Centro location. Very nice beachfront with the ability to walk in either direction. Very friendly and helpful staff.
positive	The concierge staffs need to be more effective and organized. I booked for the tour but then wait at the lobby and havent got noticed when the tour guide came. The staff names Johan still not so skillful. There are no spa staffs at the pool at around 12:00, so I cant ask info about massage. Some restaurant staffs told that they are off for lunch, which is quite unprofessional.Great location that linked directly to the BTS station Surasak, beauty and modern infinity pools with excelent view, fabulous buffet breakfast with well trained staffs in Glass house restaurant, receptionist, bell doors, pool are most of the wow factors in Eastin Sathorn Bangkok.
positive	difficulty to find car parkingstaff are very kind and helpfully,clean
positive	Loads of noise if facing the street side and chamber mades where too loud in the morning shouting.Clean, modern, confy beds and big bathroom, nice receptions staff and value for money.
positive	Don't use Google Maps to find the hotel - it sent me around in circles for ages! Just walk past the back of the town hall, and take the first turn right. There it is, with its small blue and orange sign.One of the nicest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in. Lovely atmosphere, staff so friendly and helpful, breakfast fine, location so good. Great value for money too!
positive	Local restaurants poor and expensive, no pubs for just a drink.Location, comfort, felt at home but on holiday.
positive	What's Not To Like!As an 'off-shoulder' stay we found wonderful wonderful people staffing your lovely Inn …their knowledge and attention to detail were excellent …felt very welcome…
positive	No blanket in the room but I guess we can ask :) We was lucky to have room with windows but very noisy during the night with the street.The team is very nice and helpful. it's easy to have some localfood in the street for a good price.
positive	No shop nearby, poor breakfast, no TV channel list, food & drink a tad expensiveStaff, room, pool, bed, safe (fits laptop) restaurant on the beach below
positive	the thai breakfast is so good，the hostess is good at cooking and everyone here is nice,love the place so so so much
positive	No mini bar in the room, you need to order. The coffee at the restaurant not that good.House keeping 👍🏼 The room 👍🏼 Staff 👍🏼 Breakfast 👍🏼 Easy to go to the mall 👍🏼 Very clean 👍🏼 Value 👍🏼 Easy checking in and check out 👍🏼
positive	This was our best stay in Niagara On The Lake. The room was fantastic the bed very comfortable. Breakfast was special , something you do not get elsewhere. The staff and service were great and the shuttle to the restaurant allows us some extra wine to enjoy our meal. We will return.
positive	The only issue was the way the booking was described i.e. 2 adults and 1 child up to 12. This suggested a room with beds sufficient, but the hotel disagreed stating an additional bed would be needed at an additional cost. The issue was that no option was given when booking to select an extra bed. I would say a misleading description at the very least. However, check in staff, Asif, was very helpful and offered a twin room at no extra cost.
positive	Nothing. It's the only place to consider if you're in the area!!!!This is a fabulous property perched on hill overlooking ionannina and the lake. Although it only has 12 rooms, it has a great restaurant, a pub and. A separate restraint where they serve a gourmet breakfast.
positive	Nice quiet place, close to all the other restaurants and hostels but quiet! Super nice staff.
positive	The building is a little old. My only complaint was that we could hear when the next room has their jacuzzi on.Attention to details, even when we entered the room, they had it dimly lit with holiday music in the background. Very friendly staff.
positive	I'd like to express my sincere appreciation for the service I got in hotel last month; Everything's fantastic - room service's good, swimming pool is wonderful, breakfast is delicious, and my husband even got a birthday cake which is really out of our expectation coz we didn't mention it at all when we checked in; In the last day, my kid felt uncomfortable and vomited due to sunstroke maybe, your lobby manager, assit manager, cleaners, bellboy, doormen helped us a lot, and someone even gave me a jar of herbs , till today, I don't know the boy's name who gave me the herb, but i want express my special thanks to him, it's quite useful. Thanks for the support from all of you guys, my kid recovered quickly. P.S. for the herbs, i think it's Thai traditional herbs, it's from khunprame.com. Anyway, thanks very much for everything in hotel, it's the wisest decision to live in Eastin Grand Sathorn hotel, i would reserve your hotel again. :-)
positive	A lot of building near by at present so maybe request a room away from the noisePoolside is perfect, with food, beverages and services close at hand, friendly attendants and space between lounges so you don't feel "on top of your neighbors". Breakfast great, large choice and warm staff. Rooms very comfortable
positive	Kind of difficult to find the apartment,of there is a big sign for it which I can see it on street will be great.Best location,good service,the staff is really nice.Definitely best choice in Prague.
positive	Bed, is too high. TV should have international channels in this type of a Hotel. Only local channels.Sri Lankan Food. 
positive	i choose the creek view room. but the room can barely see any creek. as reception told me , i can see from the corner a little. so it's called creek room.arrive at 11:30, give us check in for 40 mins. always it's before 2pm. all employee are polite. room is clean and decoration is relatively new. but something are missing thought. we have only 1 cup in the room. sometimes they forgot towel
positive	The area that the hotel is located in is pretty run down, containing mainly very small workshops and businesses. There is nothing to see around and nowhere to eat nearby.The location of the hotel is excellent for the airport - about 5 minutes drive from Managua's main airport. The owner was delightful and cooked dinner specially for us in the evening. There is parking within the hotel compound, that is very safe. The hotel will readily organise taxis to the airport, if needed. Inside the hotel everything is spotlessly clean.
positive	Breakfast was a bit pricey, but there are plenty of options nearby.The staff were very kind and helpful. The location was ideal, and the whole place was quite trendy.
positive	Onsen and dining area are great Great location, right beside the gondola
positive	Complicated to get a taxi to go there and if you find one, they would charge 40 kuai one way. Its a 10-15 minutes drive but it is the price they ask for as they wont have customers to come back to the city center. The best way to join the city center and come back is definitely using bikes. Plus, it is a nice ride!The owner has been amazing, very nice and helpful, the hostel is very clean (both commun space and rooms), a lot of light. Our room had a crazy view on the mountains, the beds are very very comfortable and even have a matress that can be warmed. Shower gel and shampoo were good quality, there was a TV and it was possible to warm the room. Very nice home made westernized breakfast. Possible to have meals otherwise. Lovely place that I highly recommand. A bit far from the city center but it actually has its positive sides: you can rent a bike for a day and bike around the area, which is gorgeous. There is a river very close and all the mountains around.
positive	Bed was a bit hard, the pillow was hard, they had extra pillows, but only limited amount. only 1 elevator, so it took some waiting time between 9.30 and 10.30am because many people with luggage were leaving and the elevator would be full. Stairs outside the building were available though if you wanted to go down without waiting.Good service, we could leave our luggage at the hotel before checkin and when we returned it was taken to our hotelroom! Free to use fridge so we could buy drinks and chill them in our room. AirCo in the room, which is good for hot summer nights.| Good rooomprice for what we got. Walking distance from many shops and 10 min walk from the subway/train station.
positive	Good location, near the beach & the center. Friendly staff and nice place to stay! Perfect when you're a solo traveller.
positive	The bed was hard and uncomfortable. Could train staff so that they can at least give directions on how to get back onto the motorway heading out if aucklandLocation great, nice facilities and rooms
positive	Close to the botanic garden and a 15 minute walk to the city centre. Nice and good equipped hotel for a reasonable & fair price with friendly staff.
positive	Although on a main road it was quiet . Close enough to Pukekura Park to easily walk there and back.
positive	A wonderful throw back to turn of the century with an air of slightly faded gentility. The staff is very accommodating with the head waiter in in charge of the dining room being exceptional. After 47 years serving and observing he is a treat! We didn't request it but somewhat they arranged a lavish Sinhalese wedding that we were lucky enough to watch from a respectful distance on our second day. Recommended!
positive	The toilet in the room is very smelly. I always avoid to use it.The hotel is very close to subway station. You can have three options on choosing what types of breakfast, whatever Japanese, buffets or western. The spring house sometimes is crowed, and you need to wait in patience.
positive	They had a couple of problems while we were there. The internet went down, the Cable cut out, and we lost water in our room. However all of these problems were resolved quickly.The room was clean and exactly what we were looking for. We had a beautiful view out the window to the mountain. The staff were very friendly, enthusiastic, and helpful!
positive	Gili Gila is unlike any other, incredibly uniquely designed and laid out hostel on the quiet and idyllic Gili Meno. The rooms are adorable and very comfortable, but the best part of the hostel is the excess of communal space - bean bags, a bar, a dining table etc. The staff and owner are so sweet and friendly and the design of the hostel really encourages travellers to socialise which was really great and resulted in one of the best and most fun nights Ive had whilst travelling. Thank you for a great stay Gili Gila! Clean,spacious, comfortable & great location - Id go back to Gili Meno just to stay here.
positive	Bathroom was a little tired and the light shone in the kids' bedroom all night and would benefit from better blinds.Very spacious unit with a good kitchen and lovely outdoor courtyard. Friendly staff, happy to please, great to have the Wainui Store across the road too.
positive	Quite steep stairs which may be an issue for elderly people.Fantastic views,good tennis court,comfortable bed,excellent shower.
positive	1. Wi-Fi was unstable. 2. The bathroom was quite cold in my apartement. In addition, the toilet sometimes had a water leakage.1. Located in the very center of the city, close to the Tiananmen Square and to a subway station (Qianmen). 2. The staff speak good English. 3. There is a restaurant inside with a wide assortment of meals and drinks, where you can have both breakfast and dinner.
positive	There were no negative issues at this venue!Spacious room, stunning view and stylish decor. Very comfortable bed especially the pillows!
positive	In case of all apts. being full of guests, there could be definitely noise from the corridor, which closely connects the rooms, but that is minor thing, otherwise it is really good option.Very good price for excellent location, willing and smiling owner and plenty of bars and restaurants around the accommodation.
positive	Treatments at the spa (massage etc) were rather overpriced. The ventilation system was pretty noisy.Great room with everything you could ask for and then some more. Location is very handy for public transport to other parts of the city, the airport and Dubai. Very nice gym with sauna and jacuzzi included in the price. Great views if you manage to secure a room high enough in the building.
positive	Service in restaurant not too good at times. Part of meal would come and rest much later. Staff were friendly for most part.Staff in lobby very helpful and accommodating.
positive	I think the restaurants could be better not enough choiceThe staff are amazing especially the boys at the pool and all the staff in the club lounge . This was our second stay there
positive	our shower was almost non existant...bathroom fan was broken.... and we would likely choose a hotel with at least a continental breakfast next time...our main reason for this choice was the pool.... it was wonderful
positive	I was ordering room service around 9pm but they don't have any food and she mentioned that tomorrow will be available.Mr.Sravan and team excellent front office
positive	It is close to everything. Walking distance to the main attractions in Beijing. The friendly environment of the hostel is definitely a plus. There is always people in the dining hall and everyone there is up to make friends.
positive	Wifi bit limited in today's world.Loved it all. Very relaxing and comfy and great TV movie channel.
positive	Better than I thought. Good security. Nice staff. Very clean. First time in a hostel and I am very happy with the Generator Hostel. I gave a 10 to The Generator Hostel and they really deserved that points.
positive	One of the waitresses for breakfast was very rude one morning. I assume she just had a bad day.Although in between two roads no noise at all. Room was basic but fulfilled all our needs. The staff was very helpful. Perfect location.
positive	no soap and shampoo in the toilet.Very close to metro, clean and safe place to stay. Highly recommended. Accessing to city center is very easy. Do not forget to bring your own locks :)
positive	NothingGuests can have privacy from other rooms, you wouldnt hear others. İt had a private beach. İts not far from attractions but still rooms are good isolated from outside so you dont hear music at nights. They prepare your room for night such as spraying mosquito spray when you are not in the room. Phi phi is in general wet place so things get stinky easily but in this hotel you smell only room scent and flowers. And excellent breakfast, there was even gouda cheese or nutella or fresh mandarin juice.
positive	It is always a gamble when staying in hostels with bigger rooms, but there should be a certain way of making guests respect peace and quiet needed for a good night's sleep during the night.An unexpected level of cleanliness for a hostel and for a really good price. I had stayed in an 8-bed mixed room with separate small rooms for the toilet and the shower and everything was really clean. The built-in drawers/lockers were good enough and the automated locker room is great, even though a bit pricy if you are staying for a longer period of time. The staff is extra nice, speaking fluent English (which is not so often in Paris).
positive	This is being very picky since we had a wonderful time but the pillows were a little hard for my liking, but again, that's just personal preference.
positive	The shower could do with a bracket in the bathroom.Excellent location and fantastic value for money. Amazing view from the balcony. Staff very helpful.
positive	Can't imagine another hostel in Beijing with a better social environment that this! Also in a great location, surrounded by good places to eat and walking distance from loads of cool streets and tourist attractions.
positive	In the rooms , mobile connection is so bad , we can not use our phones.
positive	I asked for a room in higher floor caz I arrived late the told me all the room are occupied except this one The location is far but I think it's one of advantages and disadvantagesAmazing staff & facility Quick check in & out
positive	The reception was slow. In fact, it seemed that they were under-staffed. The room was small for 8 people.The bed was very comfortable. Wifi was super, and the room was clean and nice. Showers were hot and sufficient. Breakfast was good and reasonable.
positive	A bit of walking is needed to find the nearest tuk-tuk / motosai stop. Mattress a little too thin.Very unique concept that makes for a very cosy stay. A community area with kitchen is provided for use.
positive	Beds are small, somewhat "rustic". Charged for coffee. Entrance road is a dirty one. Only accept cash.The attention of its owner, makes you feel at home. Exquisite food, different. It´s a quiet place, away from the noise, and green. Close to Bogota.
positive	Bed was a bit uncomfortableAble to do laundry and barbecue
positive	The breakfast buffet was fine, but scrambled eggs throughout Japan seem to have been left soggy. After a couple days of the same buffet with very little variation, I was done with it. My wife was happy day after day because of the yogurt, though. (Yogurt and cream in Japan seems to be consistently rich).This hotel had one of the most comfortable beds we found in our 8 hotels we stayed in this trip. The room was simple, but we were usually out in the city when we wanted anything other than simple. Most important to us, you could completely block out the light with the locking window shade.
positive	Hollandaise sauce out of a bottle. Lucky I asked if it was fresh and was informed it wasn't freshly made😕.Friendly staff on reception. Lovely spacious studio. Enjoyed the spa. Breakfast was OK.
positive	I booked a 3 night stay and after the second night I was told I had to move into a different room which was annoying because I had to move all my stuff even tho I'd got settled in one bed.Check in was easy and smooth... the beds are a good size... very private bunks with curtains and the individual lockers were even big enough to fit my huge backpack in so I could lock away all of my things 😃...nice balconies in the rooms... all clean and good facilities.
positive	The double bed is more 2 single bedsYou literally could not be in a better spot in the centre of Prague!! Cracking restaurants, sights and tourist attractions are only a few steps away. The owners are kind, caring and helpful and I would recommend staying here to anyone booking for a place in Prague!!
positive	Good wifi, location, very clean, friendly helpful staff, air conditioner
positive	No wifi in the room (if you stay in the houses)the view the infinite pool the little houses are just perfect the staff the yoga class
positive	Fans in bathroom very noisy and ski lockers tiny. Another small point for improvement was we ordered an extra bed in the room ahead of time and it wasn't made up for us - we had to do, which isn't ideal.Good size rooms, rooms very sound proof and great location to skiing and good restaurants. Hotel also charming 'old world' decor.
positive	Our trip to Dubai and staying at Premiere Inn was fantastic. The staff were brilliant. Everyone was like happy to help and would go an extra mile to assist us. My family had an amazing time at Premiere Inn and I would highly recommend it.
positive	Nothing... tip put a mirror in the room so the woman can do het make up while husband is showering...Great price... simple good breakfast... great rooms...
positive	Water flow of shower is not enough and water temperature is not steady.Nice & clean room
positive	Unfortunately it was quite loud at night because of barking dogs in the neighborhood and slamming windows/doors as it was windyVery helpful hosts, great breakfast and dinner, big and clean room
positive	Rather pricey for what you get - but the case with a lot of barilocheGreat location in the middle of Bariloche. Excellent restaurant downstaris
positive	Everything was perfect.We were in Paris for our honeymoon and Hotel La Comtesse was just lovely. The hotel is in a lovely neighborhood near the Eiffel Tower. The staff was friendly, the room was warm, and amazingly quite (amazing since it was on a rather big busy street). It is also in very close proximity of the metro station so it was perfect for getting around in Paris. It was never too far away from where you'd like to see as first timers in Paris (as we). On our 3rd day I got sick and the staff at the reception got me a nice, english-speaking doctor very quick, early in the morning. Would definatelty stay again and recommend 
positive	Food quality and selection.Limited selection and average quality of buffet food.
positive	In the room the path tube is separated only with glass and no door I did not like the toilet and shower arrangement as they are separatedRoom size and friendly staff
positive	Room too small, no elevator and absence of fridge, but these were minor and manageable issues. It is worthy a note that the heating device of the room was not enough to keep us perfectly warm.New and clean hotel, friendly staff, good breakfast, convenient location near Nevsky Prospekt, metro stations and supermarkets
positive	All was goodCleanness, the staff customers service was excellent, breakfast delicious
positive	Nothing.The room service menu, available also at the lobby and pool bars, was extensive and reasonably priced. Staff everywhere were competent and friendly. Loved the direct access ramp to the sky train.
positive	We did a trip around the block looking for the access to the carpark - entry is behind Marine Parade and wasn't particularly well sign posted. It would have been nice if the complementary access to the gym facilities at Ocean Spa included the pool access. Given there is no pool in the hotel, having complementary access to the one across the road would be a great addition for families (instead, we paid an additional $30 to go for a swim).Brilliant location, overlooking Marine Parade and across the road from Ocean Spa and heated pool complex. The staff were outstanding - so friendly and helpful. The room was lovely and quiet - we had a great night's sleep on very comfy beds. Easy walk to Napier sights. We'll be staying again next time we visit.
positive	Absence of an air conditioner. However a fan was provided for warmer days.Fabulous location with breathtaking views and close proximity to sun kissed beaches, cosy restaurants and cafes.
positive	Hot tub jets not working ;(Great staff!! So helpful, very friendly and accomodating. The executive floor with fire places and comfy lounge is very classy.
positive	We liked everything! It was nice, the staff was helpfull, the room was clean, and big enough, the check in-check out was very quick.
positive	nilvery handy to town. staff very friendly also the room was clean and spacious.i liked the perk coffee they gave us when we arrived would stay there again,
positive	Quite a walking distance from the station especially if your luggage is big.Good breakfast. Laundry and public bath is good but the bath is not as big as portrayed in the picture.
positive	Really helpful staff, accurate info given to walk into centre and cable car back, excellent. Breakfast was a huge bonus, cereal and fruit, really good.
positive	Very friendly and helpful staff. We were on the 5th floor and had a very good sea view. Large comfortable room. Very clean. Interesting town with Art Deco architecture. Te Nata Peak is well worth a visit. Amazing views over Hawke's Bay and surrounding area.
positive	Rooms and especially bathroom is a bit basic for this pricerange. No fridge in the room.Great view, lovely balcony with hammock. Very nice restaurant with great food (the pumpkin curry of the buffet is lovely!). Perfect kids play corner. Nice and friendly staff.
positive	Nothing that we didn't like, although it is worth mentioning that there is no lift in the building so you have to walk up 4 flights of stairs to get to the suiteThis place is a gem. Owner is very helpful, suite is wonderful and breakfast is first class. We will definitely be going back!
positive	The staff was incredible. Resort beautiful. Really breathtaking. I would recommend
positive	Bed was a little softVery well equipped. Appreciated the coffee plunger and that coffee renewed on second day
positive	Little bit confused to find entrance....Nice place and nice room
positive	Very basic essentials - just 2 coat hangers in the wardrobe! Too far out of town to get to any restaurants on foot. The TV channels on offer did not carry the Australian Open Tennis finals - a real shame.Rooms are very spacious, and most had a small patio area. Convenient coffee shop and take-away store across the road. Easy walk to the beach.
positive	The jam at breakfast was amazing. Very nice and helpful staff.
positive	To top it off, would be great if had a poolGreat views
positive	We could not be happier with the welcome to Nicaragua we received from Gabby, Toby and Thier family. It was a joy to stay with them,the facilities are clean. Comfortable and breakfast tasty and nutritious. We got lots of great advice and help regarding things to see and do as well as onward travel. The situation is very central and safe for all this beautiful city has to offer.We would not hesitate to stay again and heartily recommend to fellow travelers.
positive	NothingFirst of all the family that run the hotel were extremely helpful and friendly! Breakfast was different every day of our 4 day stay and was yummy (we love Mexican cuisine!) The free WiFi was strong and reliable. The location was perfect - walking distance to all of the main attractions without being in the middle of the hustle and bustle.
positive	My 3 week stay in Sri Lanka ended at Lanka Hostels Colombo. Lanaka Hostels Colombo added more colour to Wonderful memories of Sri Lanka. They have great staff who will take care of you like a little baby. The pool was relaxing and loved the breakfast. Only place I got sausages, eggs, bread butter, jam with fruits. It was absolutely worth the money. Very clean specious rooms, clean bathrooms with loads of public area to chill. Best wifi I had in Sri Lanka. Well I have nothing bad to say about this place. Hope the best for them and wish them luck. Central location close to station shopping mall and plenty of shops on the galle road. Love the sunset which was 5minutes away to the beach.
positive	The apt. is great, but you can hear the neighbors, almost to the dot, so it's something to be aware of.Location was great, and Freddy was very helpful and responsive in making us feel comfortable.
positive	Stingy with complimentary tea & coffee. Offered ground coffee but in a smaller than needed quantity for decent cup of coffee. Wanted to record credit card no and expiry on booking form in case of breakages etc. High Potential for fraudLovely large room with good kitchen comfortable beds wi-fi and nice spa bath.Offered complimentary ground coffee
positive	The room is pretty small.The location. Not as busy as Shinjuku but it can be accessed in a few metro stops. It's also very close to the high-end shopping districts such as Midtown.
positive	Original and creative hotel very good value for money. Sebastian and Paul are very welcomming. I strongly recommand it
positive	Amazing resort with lovely staffs. Many activities to do at the resort. Free shuttle bus to Ubud center.
positive	I booked this hotel for my daughter and her friend over Christmas. The staff were very kind and helpful.
positive	Alsos House is located right next to the walking paths of Kalampaka and has a beautiful view. The mattress was really comfortable and the shower was lovely. Highly recommend!
positive	-amazing staff and "crazy" place. you feel in a movie... great experience.
positive	A pleasant and friendly welcome. The property was great and surroundings picturesque. Would definitely recommend to others and will be staying again on our next visit.
positive	Wifi was very very poor and intermittent.The size as well as the patio and view of the fields.
positive	The staff were efficient and helpful, especially the concierge. The chocolate shop was wonderfully surprising. The area by the river and pool was a great catch your breath and enjoy the view with a drink place. Check in and check out was a breeze. The room was large and the balcony overlooking the river was amazing.
positive	Our first room had an old TV without cable. The next night we asked to move room and the staff were helpful in doing this and then the TV was good and with cable. Room was a little coldGood city view from our room. Overall very clean and tidy hotel
positive	Secure wifi didn't work well in the room - you had to go into the corridor for it to be reliable. Non-secure wifi options did work in the room.Beautiful old restored colonial house with central garden/fountain. Clean comfortable room, friendly staff. Quiet considering the downtown location. Easy to meet and chat with other guests. Across the street from the Chaya Maya, great local food!
positive	Because there is no door between the second and ground floor, conversations drift up at night. If a group is talking in the cafe, you'll be able to hear all of it in your room. I hope the hostel installs doors between the two floors someday, because this is my only real complaint with Leo.The cafe has good cheap food, and the facilities are pretty clean. The location is a short walk from most major tourist attractions, such as the Forbidden City, Mao's Mausoleum, Tiananmen Square, and the National Museum of China. The staff were very helpful and friendly. They helped us sort out a problem with one of our flights, and booked tickets for an acrobatics show. You can also do a special tour of the great wall with Leo Hostel.
positive	Nothing to moan about - though the first room given poor condition but was changed promptlyThe location is very good .. though hidden off Beijing Lu ... easy access to metro buses and airport bus .. and local Noodle Street restaurants !
positive	- poor wifi - the hotel takes a margin on reservations for boats and excursions But an excellent stay. We would definitely go back there and recommend it.- great, calm location. Ideal for couples. 10 minutes from the pier and the animation - staff: extremely available and nice. Speaks french and english (rare enough to be mentionned) - breakfast: great variety of cakes, pankakes, eggs, french viennoiseries, and dishes such as muesli made for you. A real pleasure - private beach with very comfortable beds
positive	The bar was very expensiveWe booked this whilst in NZ as a place to stay before flying back to the UK. Lovely helpful staff, nice comfy room with cooking facilities
positive	The elevator is not exactly same level with the room (need to go by stairs but only few steps). We carry quite huge luggage so its little bit unconfortable, but should be no problem with others which dont carry alot of stuffEverything! The staffs are friendly and really helpful. The room is clean, comfortable and warm (our visit was on winter). The place is very close to tram station, internet is great and very cheap price.
positive	Good location. There is a Lawson just below the hotel building. Many good restaurants nearby. Hotel offer the automatical wash machines and dry machines in 7F also are convenient. Reception is very kind to support.
positive	I personally was not a huge fan of the breakfast options, but if you are happy to eat anything you could fill up.Wonderful staff, great location and very clean rooms! If this is within your budget, book!
positive	The reception staff is supposed to make us feel welcome but didn't even smile when we checked in..It was as if we were at the immigration counter... The rest of the staff were nice.. we stayed at the 3 room apartment it was very spacious and clean. The food is very expensive here..
positive	The WiFi wasn't that good from time to time. The breakfast was very basic but if you buy something to add it's nice.I really liked the style of the hostel even though there are not that many Hogwarts related decorations but still nice. The rooms were very clean and comfortable with even a small terrace. Free good towels included.
positive	GYMThe service of the hotel was icing on the cake with the efforts of Lily one of the reception team member, who made it all great. She had been great to serve at her best. Great team great hotel wonderful stay keep it up
positive	Super friendly staff! Nice room in old romantic style. Location superb.
positive	The hotel lighting could have been brighter. We could not work the tv, but we didn't mind and didn't ask for help.Quiet Location. Staff were friendly, but very professional. They did not intrude except when asked for help. We had problems with our return flights being cancelled and delayed and they went beyond the call of duty to assist us. The breakfast was outstanding with different choices each day, fresh fruit and healthy cereal, but also special baked items each day. Professional attitude of staff seemed sincere, not fake. We were very pleased with this choice of a smaller businesslike hotel.
positive	- The room was a bit humid - Ask for a room with a view of the lake, ours had a view towards the stairs to the yard and to the main area- Great location, only ten mins on foot to the centre of Kandy - Large and clean room - Warm welcome and accommodating hosts, we were helped with laundry, transport and restaurant recommendations - Great and nourishing breakfast with a nice view of the lake
positive	I'm being really picky here... I don't like paying for a towel. Other than that, this hostel is a great place, apart from the location, as its far from the main bars and restaurants. Also not a very good area to walk around after dark!The best breakfast I've had in South America! Soap, hand towels and hooks in bathrooms + a chair / stool. I wanted this hostel to be the first one that I give a perfect score, oh well my search continues...
positive	Lacked some essentials (salt/pepper, oil, cling wrap for sandwiches/leftovers & extra garbage bags). Can be a bit noisy on Friday night with the bar across the street.Great location, comfortable with some basics to cook your own meals. Friendly staff whom provided maps and good tips for activities and restaurants.
positive	Prompt and friendly shuttle service to and from airport. High standard facilities including beautifully presented room with tasteful decor and every convenience. Enjoyed sitting outside bar area after dinner with a drink and chatting with other guests. Nice to see children catered for with a large grassed area, cubby house and sandpit with toys.
positive	I asked repeatedly if the receptionist had put in my Aeroplan rewards card number into the system and she said they had. However upon returning I learned no rewards number was put in. Close to the subway and also to many restaurants both cheap and expensive. Very local.Great location for business and shopping at the Silk Market. Only a 8 minute walk away. Big beautiful rooms with fruits and a cheesecake awaiting after my check in.
positive	The master electronic pad in the room did not work all week. Light in bathroom broken. To stations are poor and fail oftenCentral location attached to wadha mall. Great staff and very clean with superb value for money
positive	Excellent staff friendly and helpful, Room with spa is spacious and very clean and tidy. Wifi unlimited and big screen. Shops are close by. I will continue to come back and tell everyone. Keep up the good work.
positive	Hard to get there by carDinner and breakfast staff peacefull place
positive	It is a wonderful place to stay. Tommy is very nice and considerate. He provides the wormest services and do all his best to show his hospitality. Just ask, and he is always there to help. The location is also excellent from KIX directly to Umni and also convenient to travel within Kyoto and the near districts. The private room is very cozy and comfortable. It is a wonderful stay here.
positive	thanks to your colleagues they are awesome specially i want to thanks Atif the front office colleague he is very friendly very quick check inn and they way he take care of me asking feed back which was great well done Atif And checkout was also excellent the Indian colleague sory i forgot his name was good and asking feed back about stay. basically you have wonderful team in your hotel a big thanks to all of them.
positive	Location is a little far from the city, with few options to reach it. Only taxi and hotel cars, which are obviously very expensive and with prices badly fixed and disclosed.Hotel facilities, comfort and breakfast.
positive	I would have found it helpful to have had more basic kitchen equipment, eg a chopping board, a wooden spoon and an oven.The units are spacious and airy with plenty of room. They are very comfortable and are well positioned close to the beach.
positive	The front of the toilet was positioned very close to the bathroom wall. I had to turn slightly sideways to sit on it and in order to walk through to get into the shower. The light from the AC temperature panel was bright enough to cast a glow in the room.I love this hotel! It has everything I wanted during my stay, especially the hot water showers. Despite being located on a busy street, the walls kept most of the sound out. The woman at the front desk is friendly, polite and helpful. She always had a smile when I returned to the hotel. Breakfast was delicious and seating is in a nice courtyard with plants. I stayed in room 4. The bed is very comfortable and the AC worked great! There is also a ceiling fan. It is very close to the El Gato Negro Cafe and Dia de los Donuts.
positive	Food was average could do with improvement but wouldn't put me off going again nor would It put me off eating there againComfy beds, clean rooms, good security, great facilities. Overall great accommodation better than some hotels I've stayed in.
positive	Located on a busy street, sirens seemed to be a constant presence. Earplugs is a must.Central location, good base in Osaka.
positive	During our stay there was a lot of building and painting activity going on and a lot of noise. Also the shower facilities were very difficult to get into. The facility did not advertise the electricity payment as well as deposit payment due on their website.The accommodation was near all the shops and shopping centers. Also close to the beach.
positive	Staff were very efficient and friendly , the breakfast was the best buffet breakfast I've ever had. Rooms were beautifully decorated with a great view to the sea.
positive	our room was located at the back of the hotel so we didn't have a great view of the property or Dubai The staff at breakfast - seating personnel could have been more attentive. we waited for 30 minutes for a cappuccino.The cleanliness of the room The staff The dining
positive	The swimming pool is almost never in the sunThe atmosphere, the amability of the staff, the colorful decoration, the strategic location, and upon everything the breakfast and its delicious and original propositions
positive	Not a thingEverything about this hotel spells luxury what a treat for Christmas. We where treated like kings and queens and always with a smile. The breakfast is exquisite and service excellent The pool is out of this world, spacious and lots of sun loungers, pool service was great and pool menu was good varied and good value Can't wait to return
positive	- basic breakfast- bed in small container with curtain - nice dormitory with small balcony - friendly and helpful staff - good central location, close to shops and food market
positive	The food was hit or miss.The resort was fabulous. Ultimate luxury!!
positive	- Menu could be different on a day to day basis not being the same everyday... - Room was small for the price of the room (but I guess most hotel rooms in Japan are small) - Japanese Front Desk Staff should know where in Tokyo English Mass is said since they said there are a lot of Filipinos who stay in Citadines...Location Filipina Front Desk Personnel Ms Mercy Padlan was very accommodating and helpful... We are very grateful
positive	The pool was not clean and the gym could do with an upgrade.This was an amazing stay. The penthouse was out of this world. The views of table mountain, the bay and Cape Town is so captivating it blows ones mind away. The penthouse was so spacious and comfortable. My family wanted to stay another night.
positive	TV reception not great. Australian open tennis in snowstorm!Stayed in 2 bedroom villa. Everything great except tv reception. Perfect location in sanur shopping strip. Lovely staff. Facilities clean quiet comfortable. Great wifi & AC. Reasonable airport transfer cost 150k. Would stay here again.
positive	Bathroom too close to bed; unavoidable noises heard across room.Staff; location; bed.
positive	I lost appointment time to dental care due to >1/5 hours wait park-men during take a look my car. Omelet taste was not meet what my family expected before.Hotel connect to public mall. Responding with hotel stays favor what I have request.
positive	What a fantastic B&B! The bbq dinner topped off a perfect stay. I would definitely stay again.
positive	The location is excellent. The room was clean and comfortable. The staff is wonderful and very friendly. It's a beautiful hotel
positive	Central location in Valladolid, comfortable room and helpful staff
positive	The rooms with ocean view are wonderful, if you like to listen to loud pub music until 2 a m If you like it quiet listen to waterfall & birds stay in the back rooms
positive	Very homely atmosphere and the Host & Hostess were extremely welcoming and always willing to oblige. Excellent Sri Lankan breakfast with a wide variety of food made to order and piping hot. Very comfortable Room with all necessary amenities. Very clean and tidy situated in a great location just 10 minutes above city centre. Very Good "Value for Money" and I would definitely go back whenever I visit Kandy. Would surely recommend Bethel to anybody looking for a clean, convenient and welcoming Homestay in Kandy
positive	Nice room Very good breakfast The owner is Very friendly and nice
positive	Nothing! Everything was just great.The breakfast at the hotel was amazing! The staffs are very nice and friendly. The environment is very comfortable i had a great time.
positive	If the bedroom door could lock it would have been better and I cannot sleep with a light on. Therefore it was dark and scary as the room was big.The hospitality was amazing.
positive	The shower was not finished in our room but we got a discount.The stuff was very very nice and the breakfast amazing with fruits, eggs, bread, marmelade, butter, jam and fresh juice
positive	This hostel didn't provide bathroom mat and the bathroom smells bad even though there's fan. Beware of the local chinese food restaurant in meishi street(across mcD) , they tend to cheat tourist. Read the menu carefully and if they offer you jasmine hot tea when they took the menu from you after you order, just ignore, it costs RMB50 just for a tea!Location not quite close to metro but still ok about 800m walk and you may want to consider bringing huge luggage since there are lots of stairs in metro station and to accross the meishi street. The rooms was nice and so orienta and they provide hot water for drinks!i really thankful for that 😃. There are lots of foods nearby and at night there is a local selling delicious BBQ in front of hotel and an old lady selling cheap local food. People said their great wall tour is a must,but i think it's quite expensive (RMB 280).
positive	It is a large hotel and the crowds at the excellent breakfast buffet can be rather overwhelming. It would have been probably cheaper to have a booking that included breakfast.Fantastic views from riverside balcony, with very busy river traffic quite riveting. Next to a main pier for water buses. The river is the best way to move around.
positive	Only need 5 minutes walk from the station. The owner is so nice and helpful,thank you so much！！！ The cat and dogs are so lovely. The room is clean and comfortable. Best breakfast of all stay in Sri Lanka！ Very nice place to stay. Hope I come again in a sunny day : )
positive	It's really difficult to find the place. I spenthink almost an hour on it. Though the location is good, but there's no big signboard or smth, so I passed by the hotel several times without knowing it was was I needed.The staff was super nice and helpful. The place really makes you feel important. Breakfast was good and big. Room is ok and AC-DC works properly. Wifi is also normal.
positive	GREAT LOCATION. CLOSE TO CITY. FRIENDLY STAFF. SPACIOUS UNIT, WE LOVED THE COURT YARD.
positive	Not much could have been done better. The curious issue became, why are the "rubber" feet under the toilet seat missing. We stayed in two different rooms on our way to Stewart Island and then back to Auckland. In both rooms the rubber feet were missing, as if some "toilet dentist" had secretly extracted them.The facility was simple and pleasant but that's not the story. The living units are exquisitely designed for maximum "ease of use." I praise the human factors for the simple but great efficiency of the interior design of the units. Rarely have I found a living quarters that is so simple to use yet so comfortable.
positive	Everything was clean, the room a bit small and without a view. The breakfast was ok, but could definately been better with more options. They did not serve pancakes or omelettes, which is usually the case in a good 5 star hotel. Other than that, everything was good!This hotel is situated within a 20 minutes walk from the Old town in a quiet and safe neighborhood. The walk to the town was not bad at all, and if you prefer you can always take a taxi which takes 5 minutes. The spa was very nice and also the massage. I recommend this hotel!
positive	The Orfura (bath tub) in my room was excellent. Autofilling with three bubble speeds. (You can buy bathsalts at Lawsons etc). The gym was EXCELLENT not enough information on the gym found on the website. Its equipt with Techngym equiptment- fully equipt. Breakfast was very good . View from my corner room on the 24th floor of Tokyo Tower a huge PLUS
positive	No vegan options in the hotel or anywhere near the hotel - this was a struggle. But the staff did make sure one of the breakfast menu warm items was vegan (but eating a regular meal only without animal products makes the meal really shallow - still thankful tho!)Super cute hotel, very nice lobby and staff. I booked a sea view room and they upgraded it to room with balcony, crazy cool (I did not ask for it). The hotel has a dreamy beach which makes the stay so awesome! Staff is really pleasant. Certainly awesome spot for honeymoon and just a holiday with family. It is not too big and feels cozy. The pool is nice and medium sized (but we only went once, just to do it). We took our swimming business to crazy beautiful beach.
positive	Restaurant service was terrible, SLOW. Food....Mas o Menos.
positive	comfortable bed, nice public place, nice clerk, best location.
positive	Only goodGreat room size, we had a triple room as family of three. Super bathroom, seperate loo. Huge closet. Very happy. Excellent view directly on to Tokyo Tower, an easy five minute walk away.
positive	Arepas only on special days for breakfast, no proper chocolate :(All our requests were met very fast. Fresh products for breakfast. Great location in safe area.
positive	The Internet sucks, but it seems that applies everywhere along that beach strip. Ok, for emails and news, but any pages with content take forever to load and FaceTime/Viber/Skype calls are a challenge. We decided to enjoy other things instead.Great location, right in the thick of things on Zicatela beach, and when the sun was too hot we could hide by the pools. Breakfast was wonderful and all the staff was cheerful and accommodating. We liked that owners were on site.
positive	The pool was dirty and unusable. No bath. Considering the price I can overlook this all 9 out of 10 I did have a huge bathroom.The price was excellent. Acces to high quality Tennis courts/ Squash courts was great.
positive	The snow in front of the hotel didn't get cleaned, so made it a little hard for pedestrians to walk to the hotelGreat gym and sauna area at Pullman hotel which is open to Mercure guests. The hotel has a great locating for exploring the city
positive	The WiFi connection is poorSafe and relaxant environment
positive	No towels provided - but you can rentThe staff at HOSTEL by BED were extremely helpful, the place very clean and beds private and comfortable. The free bottles of water and complimentary snacks/ breakfast were a bonus. By far one of the best hostels I have stayed in.
positive	Locker for charge. Receptionists lack enthusiasm on work. Not feeling welcome when facing some of them.Modern design, convenient room facilities, big room space. Near to several subway stations.
positive	It would have been nice to have at least one pool opened late in the evening. Would have been nice to have windsurfing or catamarans activities close in the area.Nice location, great service, three pools with various kind of quietness and animations. Zen music outside. Nice restaurants with various ambiances and food. The room with jacuzzi was great ! 
positive	Not a thing.This is a great boutique hotel. The location is outstanding, the staff is excellent, and the breakfast is very tasty and extensive. We will definitely stay there again if, and when, we visit Buenos Aires in the future.
positive	Hotel only provides one key per room. This made it a little tricky for the two of us to plan our evening because we ventured out separately.Awesome location. Great value for this area of Osaka. Hotel allowed us to store our luggage after check-out until 7:00PM even though the posted policy is until 5:00PM.
positive	Some confusion when checking out when we were told we could get a short ride with all our ski luggage in the courtesy car and ended up walking.Relaxed and comfortable hotel with good facilities, and very well located to get around Vancouver
positive	Months ago we were told Harbouredge couldn't accommodate us and we were given different accommodation. When we got to the other place ( late at night)with all our luggage, we were told things had changed again and we should go back to Harbouredge- 'had to load the car and drive there!Living arias very spacious
positive	It really is great value for money. It also has a good atmosphere. All houses are decorated in a truely african way. Beautiful garden. The hosts are real friendly and helpful. Kids loved the swimming pool and trampoline. We like this part of Pretoria. It is safe and feels real (people walking in the street). Safe parking.
positive	I booked for the location, Being so close to Happo's gondola was perfect. What I didn't expect was the overwhelming friendliness of the staff, They made the stay that much better I don't think I will consider staying anywhere else on my next trip to Hakuba. The facilities are modern and very clean, The drying room is huge and easily accessible after a massive day and you can't beat having a bath in the hotels own Onsen. Particularly the outdoor bath when it's snowing.
positive	Nice breakfast (not superb). Excellent location (five blocks away from Promenade des Anglais). Lovely and helpful staff. I am looking forward to going back soon.
positive	They could provide bigger towels :-)Excellent service. The family running the business is really kind and nice. They really try to make your stay the best.
positive	NoneCould do v more local food nearby. Family room shld give more psx wifi
positive	the swimming pool was disappointed. but have to accomodate with the excellent room and service from staff
positive	Would be nice if the check in staff explained a little bit more about the facilities/features of the hotel. Example we weren't told about the sky lounge, we just found it ourselves. It was a great place so if they told people about that stuff then more people would be able to enjoy itExcellent value for money, comfy beds, nice rooms, clean and spacious, nice bathroom. Location was great. Sky lounge on the top level was nice place to chill and grab a drink. Staff were helpful when asking questions/advice on where to go/things to do in Abu Dhabi. Would definitely like to stay again if in Abu Dhabi.
positive	Absolutely nothing. Ma Sushi is closed on Sundays, could not try it! :)Very very good place to stay. Great location, very close to metro, across Police Station so safe to be there. Beside all of them, Frederick is very kind and welcoming person. If we will go to Paris again, surely we will be at your apartment again Frederick! Cozy and quite enough apartment, very clean :)
positive	It was a good place to stay. No view but that wasn't important for me. Definitely was recommend and would stay there again.Breakfast was good. Bed was very comfy. Great location. Staff are very helpful.
positive	Everything. Very clean, great location, super nice and helpful staff, love the atmosphere, 10/10 would recommend and stay again.
positive	The location is in a very busy place. The luggage took one hour to reach the room. Valet parking can be slow.The hotel is very clean and cozy. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There's a nearby shopping mall. Check in and out went very smooth. The sky lounge is pretty chill.
positive	The travel agency located in the hotel was horrible. We asked to rent a car and got it two days later after what we were initially told. We had to constantly ask in order to get service.Excellent location, close to the airport and major attractions, near the metro also in case you didn't rent a car, very clean. The reception staff were very friendly.
positive	Initial access to property. No name on outside intercoms to indicate which unit the owner is in to access unit.Great Unit, and close to Main street
positive	Nice patio, mexican style. comfy bed, helpfull staf
positive	Food is so soThe pool and location at the beach are great . Not too busy
positive	OUR 2nd stay here. SO clean, New, modern, interesting design.. Staff are friendly and easy going. Will Come again! ;-)
positive	Almost nothing. The breakfast is just fine. Below my expectations of a five-stars hotel. But it is still fine and good enough.This is a very very good hotel. Everything is great. The swimming pool is the best for kids.
positive	Total luxury. From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty. The room was spacious and so comfortable it was a struggle to leave. Coupled with the fact that the hotel was located centrally for all our needs I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I next visit Abu Dhabi. With a welcome like this we'd be mad not to go back.
positive	Nothing!We stayed only one night...it would've been great to enjoy more Romana's Family. The room was clean and confortable and they did their best to make our stay unforgettable: a typical Sri Lankan dinner home cooked, a super breakfast...and first of all their kindness. We really had a lot of fun! A peacock always sleeps on the tree in front of the house😊..Mangiu tuctuc!
positive	- DSTV channels worked intermittently- Excellent Breakfast of eggs, chicken fingers, mushrooms, fruit juice, cereals, coffee, tea, fresh fruit, yoghurt, hash browns - Comfortable beds - Spacious rooms and living areas. - Great facilities like a microwave, fridge, stove etc - Excellent attitude by the staff
positive	poor hot water. Used the tub with the jets and it came out lukewarm.location was awesome, close to the downtown (1 block). Very clean and cute. Amazing breakfast.
positive	poor wifi connection dogs barking at nite in the hood smoking in the courtyardexcellent location many restaurants 10 min leisure walk to beach friendly staff excellent breakfast easy to make friends
positive	The breakfast is a bit poor, everyday the same (bread, marmalade, 1 egg, 1 small portion of fruits) and after a few nights it became a bit boring, not a good value considering the price. Dogs barking in the night, very early morning... but this is South America, I guess...The location and the outdoor kitchen. Room was comfortable and cleaned everyday.
positive	only one less than perfect thing at Hostel Lagares and is wifi and is likely fault of Argentina wifi providers being like all other Argentina goods, services and food suppliers all out of control crooks obviously. How food in Argentina cost more than Norway is plain criminality run amuk. McD burger $1 euro or less almost everywhere is over $2 euro in Mendoza Argentian with per cap gdp of under $10k = definition of insanity.Hostel Lagares 10 of 10 great hostel !!
positive	Nothing, all goodInteresting place, reviews are either very good or very bad. We stayed twice, a week apart and have nothing but good things to say. Great facilities, clean, tidy, comfortable beds and amenable staff. Don't let the negative reviews put you off. Also really good value.
positive	Hmm...Difficult question.Perhaps a 24 hour room service..Disability friendly features of the room were excellent. Staff were very hospitable,cordial.good job,front office,service,stewards. Housekeeping needs special mention too-efficient. True to your USP, the sleep quality was incomparable and unbeatable. Missing the comfortable bed and the fluffy pillows!! Will definitely return.😊😊
positive	The shower's water pressure.The owner was very nice and polite. He has a dog, i think lucky was his name, that welcomes guests too. The motel has free unlimited wi-fi. The rooms are huge and clean. The beds are just heaven. The kitchen area is big and you can prepare yourself a meal with no difficults.
positive	NothingMost wonderful and kind people we ever met during our 2 month trip in Indonesia. They are also very very good cooks! We eat every dish at the little restaurant and it was all great!
positive	Breakfast was not included but was well worth paying for, yummy omelettes!Incredible views, spacious, clean, and airy rooms. Great location just minutes from the Eiffel tower, musee Rodin, and Invalides.
positive	We had a private room, butikker we share the bathroom With the people who have choice the hostelsroom. The light in the coridor was lighting against som smill Windows in the room andre wake us up in the night. One bathroom is not enough.Very nice breakfast, good location and Fernando was very very helpful With excursions and tips.
positive	Staff were very friendly and really helpful. The location is great-situated right next to Happo Gondola with the free shuttle stop to 47 at end of the driveway. Also ski hire, next door, great coffee across road, and many places to eat nearby.
positive	Altogether very good room, only small downside, if I have to find something, was the shower spray that was not articulated and washing myself was a bit awkward.Very kind staff and management, clean room and bathroom. Great value for money, considering the very central location.
positive	The hostel is pretty clean and cozy. Stuff is super friendly and it's close to the pier if you're planning to go to Phi Phi island after.
positive	You could hear a lot of noise from the street. It didnt bother us much because we live in the centre of a city. But it could bother some people.Very friendly staff, excellent location. Value for money!!!! Loved Oaxaca and the villages in the valley.
positive	The supply of tea bags, milk cartons etc could have been a little more generous!It was incredibly spacious with separate sitting and bedrooms, across the entire house, with views across the park from the front. The bed is very comfortable, with a spacious bathroom and lots of quaint decorative features.
positive	We loved our little cottage in the bush...It is a beautiful place where you can relax, enjoy a braai, reading a book in the living room. Although at the beginning we wished to be in the cottage up the hill, we fell in love with our own cottage. Thank you Baby Rose for your welcome.
positive	Breakfast could be better.Great view from the windows, big rooms and bathroom.
positive	Smell of the bed. Mattress was not firm.Location. Old British colonial style, breakfast was good.
positive	We were welcomed warmly like old friend. A very comfortable room with outdoor area. Breakfast was delicious and well presented. Thank you to our lovely hosts
positive	Kettle in room would have been brilliant. The bedroom was at the front and the trams are very noisy and the room shakes!Close to railway station warm room
positive	Parking was fairly difficultThe hotel was in the art deco area of Wellinton and was full of character. Nice light continental breakfast. Staff very friendly.
positive	towels and food wasn't so greatstuff, location, interior
positive	Free wifi could do with more work. Going back to the office to get more data is not convenient. Otherwise everything else is great.Excellent location. Kayaks and bikes Great place for small family to stay. The view from the balcony is terrific. Highly recommend this place.
positive	No screens on windows. No airconditioning. Sofa bed was uncomfortable. Kids slept on mattress on floor both nights rather than saggy sofa bed. Shower was slippery at first and you had to step up into it. Injured ankle and leg due to slipping.The views were amazing. The location was fabulous with the beach right outside hotel. Lots of leisure equipment available. The room was a good size with windows that open for breeze and decking to sit and watch the water. The staff were very helpful and friendly.
positive	it's a little bit hard to find the place, but you can always aks someone to show you the way :)it was a good value for money, room was ok and the location was great, it is a very good choice for one night
positive	The food and breakfast buffet not that tasty.The room service was fast and excellent. We need hmdi cable, the engineering came to bring the cable and he also help us to plug the cable.
positive	Noise from one or more apartments one night of our stay. It stopped by midnight.The staff responded quickly and efficiently to all requests and queries. Nothing was a bother.
positive	Frankly, we enjoyed every minute we spent o'er there.Had we have few more days left, we would not hesitate to stay a bit longer. The staff and meals were excellent. Reckon we shall recommend this facility to our friends.
positive	breakfast is the same everydaynice staff, the reception staff is so helpful and heart warming. location is great,it's very near to the entrance of PETRA.
positive	Great host and really care for his guests, family run business, very welcoming and helpful, overall great place, very quiet, adjusted breakfast to our dietary requirements
positive	Everything in the general store was overpriced. If those prices were more reasonable it would've been perfect.Incredible service. Incredible week for our honeymoon, we'll be back on our 10th anniversary :)
positive	That I had to pay an additional $12 for parking over and above the advertised price...just include it from the get go.The location was great. It was late Friday night when we arrived and the second we opened our car door the fireworks over the falls started which we had a good view of from the front of the building. We had a room in the tower and the room was very large and spotless.
positive	The breakfast experience should be improved. When we arrived at 8.20 am no more big plate, no more croissant....We had to wait the next croissants delivery. Upon arrival, we had to wait as most tables were waiting to be cleaned. I think you should add more staff to clean the tables specially during peak time. By the way, hot croissants were delicious!Perfect sleep!
positive	Inside the room, there is some area I can't receive the wifi signal of the hotel.1. The room size is large. 2. The location is excellent. It's quite near the JR Namba. Right At the Exit 28, 29 of Namba Walk! 3. There is a supermarket nearby. 4. It's very convenient to take buses, MRT, and Train.
positive	I was quite stiff in the morning and I think it was because of the pillow. Typically the pillow I use is much firmer. Maybe a choice of pillows would be good.I found the room very clean and comfortable. The staff were also excellent.
positive	THE PILLOWS ARE NOT THAT COMFORTABLE, AND MAYBE EXTENDING THE TIME FOR THE SNACKS AROUND THE POOL.THE STAFF MADE THE STAY MUCH MORE AMAZING! THEY WERE ALL SO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL
positive	It would be nice to have a larger fridge in the room. Access to the kitchen would also be nice.The room was very comfortable and the house has plenty of activities. The staff are really friendly.
positive	The shower on my room would drain a little slow leaving a mess after the water went down. The maid staff food not really clean the room well and they didn't replace my towels.Location waa excellent. A close walk to the Prague train station and near Wenceslas Square and the old town.
positive	It's hard to find, especially at night. Taxi don't like going into the hutong because they can get stuck, so be prepared to walk.Great place. Small friendly hotel with lots of character in the heart of the old hutongs. The area felt very safe, even at night. Lots of local cafes and restaurants. Close to the Bell tower with easy transport to central Beijing.
positive	Front office should have more people to process inquiries and requests from guests faster. Most of the time they were overwhelmed since they do so many things. You have to wait for even small things like reactivating your room key card.Staff were very friendly down to the room cleaners. Breakfast was very good. The hotel is very close to commercial shopping centre like Baniyas square and the creek 
positive	I loved every minute...The view from my room was just awesome - beautiful blue pool outside, exclusive walls inside the rooms - everything was just awesome. I would love to experience IRIS on my next visit...
positive	Most of the staff were grumpy but that did not mean the hotel did not do its job because it provided a great breakfast and locationBreakfast was great, and me and my friend got a double bed each instead of a twin room.
positive	Weak WiFi few hours due to many connections. Only two bathrooms on ground levelNice beds with chargers, nice equipped kitchen, clean bathroom and rooms, good outside area, staff is very comprehensive and helpful (we were two hours early for check in and got beds after 1h, postponed our time with no issue as my nephew was not feeling well).
positive	Quiet location and a quiet room. Heat controls were right in the room so we could cool down at night and warm up in the morning. Underground parking and the restaurant attached was nice as it was very cold when we were there.
positive	Always needs to login to wifi when back in the room, also limited to only 3 devices.Great place, we always stay here when in Abu Dhabi. Right beside all Wahda mall. Nice restaurants nearby. Indoor swimming pool at the 31st floor has an amazing view.
positive	The hotel is very near to metro and also very near to Arbat street - a great location if you are here as tourist and also for business. Rooms are well heated and even if the view from windows is not too great, this is fully compensated by the excellent location. I used metro (one trip is 150 RUB and you can pay by card) and also Uber (850 RUB standard fee to go to SVO airport). Around the corner in 50 meters there is a sports store, if you come unprepared for Russian winter. Also I enjoyed nearby Paul Cafe and the Rukola Restaurant (10 minutes distance, on Arbat street). I did not take the breakfast from hotel, since there are many options to eat nearby, and I wanted to test all. Also cool to visit: Starbucks Arbat and Hard Rock Cafe (3 minutes away). All in all, I loved this hotel and I would come again any time.
positive	A bit tight on space for a longer stayAmazing view, great value for money
positive	No complains. Everything absolutelly fine.Very well located, pleasant staff and clean.
positive	Loved the buffet breakfast... with a view of the Eiffel Tower!!!
positive	Nothing negative I can think of. All very pleasant.Staff were very helpful, did everything to make our trip enjoyable. Lovely roof top bar with views of the city.
positive	- that night weather was quite chilly and it was unable to set AC for heating, - room is quite small, but enough to sleep in comfort, - i would appreciate better coffee for breakfast.+ design of bathroom is just great, + rooms are modern and clean, renovated not too long ago, + location is fabulous, right at the seaside with free parking places 5mins from hotel, + friendly staff, + price/quality ratio is the best you can have!
positive	Definitely it was my best choice to choose the new lanka hostels Colombo. Centralized location made it very easy for me on my last day of the tour. Very comfortable beds, nice arrangements and most of all the pool really made me relaxed. I need to mention about the nice care taker and the staff.
positive	The rooms are a bit dark. But I think this is a general problem of St.Petersburg.We stayed here two times in one week so I accidentally wrote my New Year's experience in the other review. We came back here in the second week of January, and again had a great experience! We now had a standard room, but still it was very comfortable, clean, with everything needed: towels, slippers. It was only a bit smaller. The breakfast was again great, there was great herbal infusion variety of tee, and awesome coffee. We had to leave at 7 on our departure date, and we could have the breakfast at 06:30, which was great! We could also leave our clothes to be washed for a fee, so in general we've got everything we needed.
positive	The room we stayed in consisted of room A and room B. The doors slammed extremely loud and we're not sound proof. I was upset that our neighbors kept coming and going... which wouldn't have been problem but every time the door slammed it would startle me.The location was the best part! We went for dinner down the street and took a stroll on the boardwalk.
positive	The overhead lights.We stayed in Oaxaca for 9 nights. This was our first visit to the city. With our adult son, we were looking for a convenient location without breaking the bank. We followed Booking.com ratings and chose the last room available at the Parador San Fernando. We were a bit disappointed when we first moved in. The room looked cold under the fluorescent lights. The next morning, we started with a fabulous Oaxacan breakfast and realized that we were within minutes to most of the main attractions in the city. We very much appreciated the friendly and caring service. Rooms were very clean. We felt safe. We had a fabulous time in Oaxaca.
positive	NothingThe view from the room was unbeatable! Being 2 mins from the incredible little bay.
positive	Can't think of anythingFriendly staff,spotlessly clean, modern, good breakfast for small hotel. Everything as it should be. Had stayed before and would again
positive	Only a few things to mention.These are only tips and no complaints! If one would like a blanket for the bed this would be nice if they could provide this. Breakfast is very basic and once they would be a bigger hotel this could use more variety. The light in the room is too bright and by using a diffrent lamp it could be more cozy plus an extra nightlamp instead of one.The location,10 minute walk to Mambo,the staff,Angela and the cleaning and breakfast ladies were very friendly and accomodating! What we liked is that it's a small property and so you could consider it as home almost. All the basic things one needs are there. Wifi very good. Airconditioning works very well .They are planning to expand and build a pool etc the coming year. We definately would stay there again. We walked to Mambo in the evening to go out for dinner etc and felt safe,as a couple to do this. Once again,a compliment for the staff!!!
positive	Aircon was too cold.I like the cafe up the hotel. Was cheap and delicious.
positive	I, personally, don't like shower floors that are open to the rest of the bathroom floor - for safety reasons. But the bathroom and the shower were clean with no issues.
positive	Would like TV in one of bedroomsThe view is breathtaking
positive	Grand Millennium Hotel, Al Wahda have friendly staff. They were very accommodating and customer service is superb, particularly, Randall from Reception. They even managed to surprise my sister with a birthday cake on December 31st! The hotel is just walking distance from the mall and from the bus station. Only few minutes away from the beach and just half an hour to reach Yas Island. It was our 2nd time to stay in the hotel and we'll definitely stay here again!
positive	Single bed!!Friendly and helpful staff. Very clean hotel. spacious room. Very central and near everything. Very good restaurants nearby
positive	The breakfast menu needs to be clearer. Continental for 2 - should we have filled out two forms? Juices include milk - We found out that we should have ticked this milk for our cereals. Just a few simple corrections would make the form clearerThe comfort
positive	Location is abit away fr the main area .Privacy and the price is reasonable. Its clean.
positive	Hector was very helpful with information and arranging transportation for us. An easy 10 minute walk to the Zocalo makes it convenient for sightseeing. The breakfast was delicious.
positive	Would have loved tv in roomLoved the bath. Great mountain view.
positive	Great location. Ideal for a short stay in the city. Shopping facilities and restaurants of wide range in the mall next to the hotel. The gym is great and well equipped. For travellers without car the nearby bus station (and the frequent buses to Dubai) is a big help (and a real bargain).
positive	There was construction scaffolding right outside my window with workers who had a view of my room. Not very private unless you keep the blind closed.The shower was the best I've ever had.
positive	I was on the top floor and occasionally had to move my laptop to get better wifi. But all in all, a solid connection and speed.Value for money. Very cheap for what you get. Comfy beds with good pillows. Spacious room and bathroom with very good shower. Close to the main train station, Wencleslas square and a tram stop. Breakfast was solid but not spectacular. Choice of cold meats, breads, jams, cereals. Hot food was only scrambled egg and sausage. But for the price, it was a very good stay.
positive	Amazing ambiance. Staff was amazing throughout our stay, always willing to help. Amazing views and mountain biking trails!
positive	Value for money is slightly on the lower side. Yet, there are the positives mentioned...Amazing location, very good breakfast, extremely nice and caring owner.
positive	I would have preferred a slightly thicker pillow, one was not quite enough and two was too deep. But everyone has their own preferences there.The bed was very good, firm but comfortable. The unit was spacious, with all the facilities that we required. An easy short walk to the beach. I can't comment on breakfast as we took our own.
positive	Everything was great.The front desk staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. In fact all the staff were excellent and the rooms were spotless. I would highly recommend this hotel.
negative	I understand that it is very cheap hotel, but still if you have 3 stars you should be up to at least some standards and they are not. The room wasn't cleaned properly after the previous guests. We had two single beds instead of one big. On my bed the bed-sheets were dirty with some yellow stains. I don't mention some dirty marks on the walls and dust on the shelves and wardrobe, but I want to mention the fungus on the bathroom floor. This was really disgusting. We had very little time to see Berlin so I had no desire to argue with them about this. But I definitely wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.Frankly speaking there is little I can say good about this hotel. The guy on the reception is ready to help you with any question. He also knows Russian for those whom it may concern.
negative	The pictures were very inaccurate. Rooms were tiny with little or no room for anything other than the bed. The was a very strong damp smell in the room. Lots of street noise. I would rate this an overall 1 only. Location good, everything else was very disappointing.
negative	I found bed bugs ...also i requested for single bed ..and they given me two separate bed ...also they charge me extra 200dhs for late chk out as i chk in abt 3am late nightNothing to say
negative	1. Paid for high floor, but provided with 11/30. 2. Staff knocked the door at 7:00 am when in sleeping. They said they mad a mistake. 3. Had to check out at 11:00. Impossible to leave the luggages there as check-in (4:00 pm).
negative	Door didn't locked. It has broken. In pictures and information there is writing free fruits basket but there was nothing about fruit. There was no body lotion. There was no bathrobe. As a summary there is writing hotel is five stars but it is maximum three stars. It was very poor.
negative	Room was very dirty, spider nets everywhere, bathroom in the worst condition imaginable with toilet scents placed in the drainage of the shower, mirrors dirty, floor unvacumed, ac filled with dirt, sheets stained( allot). 1 pillow, no pillow case on it and very dirty. Fridge not working, dirty as hell inside( worst hotel in Bali I have ever been) very disappointing since the pictures looked nice, and the review rate should be at a 5.I didn't like much, a bit unhappy about it
negative	Staffs are not helpfull, room was terrible, smell of room is teriible.Nothing I like in this hotel
negative	Bathrooms/shower facilities are a joke. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Piping hot one night. Barely worked the next day. Hard to find 1 that works!! or was not smelly - this is separate to no hot water 1 morning. A hostel needs showers. The showers are not linked to rooms, you need to get up early to get one! The area felt unsafe. I took cabs & 2 taxi drivers were shocked a hostel was there - do not walk alone. Do not listen to staff who say it is really safe. Staff couldn't give me a receipt because wifi was down?? Turns out they charged my card when it was still supposed to be free to cancel,not on arrival. Staff think they are great, but they are not that friendly. Who can stay there and not want a shower for their stay or to walk home safely??The building is nice, airy, rooms are good. But in middle of night there was a flood or something, lots of noise - no hot water in morning, no notice, no apologies. Could not shower!
negative	^I booked the Hotel for my friends and they asked for a taxi to to Airport. It was overpriced,the Hotel should have called a taxi with taximeter or a reasonable one. sorry but that's sad. Because they are white? I hate racism
negative	The staff were not helpful had to carry my travel case and rucksack up flight of concrete steps . The room was freezing cold even though sun was shining outside .. The restaurtant was freezing cold had to were my coat and extra clothing underneath to keep warm all of the time .. Firt meal I had was cold when it arrived.. Horrible two days here .. Lack of information from booking .com about this place and lack of help and information from staff. and noise from 12:00 midnight coming from the restaurant area went on for two hours then quiet until 5:00 am ..Nothing to like here , it was cold through the whole building no heating . reviews did not give accurate information
negative	dont rent the room if the room is not ready for a guest to stay..such a discrespect to the guest. The room no is 724 please fix as below.I will return soon.dont dissapoint me again 1)Basin chocked 2)Bath tub plug is not workable 3)Drink can dented in minibar 4)aircond not cold enough 5)hot water not hot enough 6)no smoking room (according to front office the room is fully occupied.how come? i do my reservation dude.)someone already took my room? 7)bad pillow (nobody can have a good rest with that pillow) 8)During check out the front office girl didnt help to smile at all ( Smile also need to pay)????or because im just wearing casual doesnt meant u guys cannot give a me a good respect. Finally , Its horrible. Im just finish my weekend in hell. IMPIANA KLCC
negative	Staff not so friendly. Rooms were available as early as 12nn but they still want 3pm check in. Not so flexible.Location was quite good. Close to Harbor City and other neighboring shopping stores.
negative	I stayed at Fairways and Bluewater Resort in Boracay and I have been charged twice by the hotel. Once on my credit card which i used on Bookings.com and a second time on arrival. Both have gone through and are not in pending anymore. I have asked multiple times to have the money refunded and they keep stating that they already have. What can i do to get this money back? I am owed close to $700AUD and they will not return my emails. I am absolutley appauled by their customer service.
negative	There was no staff of any kind here. This property should be removed from booking.com, or strictly warned. And, the location is EXTREMELY hard to find. my taxi driver took 1 hour to locate the property from the airport, and had to stop many times to ask for help. A disaster of an experience.This experience was a disaster. No one was at the hotel to let me in. I was told, by phone, that i would have to wait on the street outside the gate for 4 hours, until the owners returned. I did not wait of course.
negative	Very old furniture and room design, not comfortable at all, I don't recommend at all. The bathroom is design is very old too. Check the pictures.Nothing
negative	I saw on website, there are 24 hours to do check in, I arrived there, 1am, and there are nobody to open the doors, I had to pay another accommodation for my first night, terrible. And there are not wifi for 2 days.Location.
negative	They should change the sign to motel. Staff is never at the front desk, bed is propped up by a metal base with paper thin sheets. Kid sized pool, no amenities, and cleanliness is awful. We had mold all over our shower curtain, on the side of the toilet, and on the walls. Toilet was cracked and the room was very musky.Location
negative	where do i start.. we got to the room and we found a poo in the toilet and toilet seat with wee on!!!! room was very small and noisy! every 30 seconds something was switching off and on again and you basically couldnt sleep! You could hear everything what was happening in the corridor and in other rooms! We didnt have a window. Wifi disconnected every 30 minutes and we rang the reception like 6 or 7 times to sort it out. Funny enough - after each call the wifi was back on so we think they were disconnecting it for some reason. Very dodgy location, a lot of homeless people asking for money and being very pushy.
negative	The location; The noisy air conditioner; The attitude of the owner
negative	They are not attentive to the guest request he stafff are not quick and snoping the client The breakfast is alway the same And the staff are alway forgetting what we ask
negative	Customer service was poor we encountered many different receptionists in 2 days and some had no idea or interest to customers , window was broken slept a night in the cold, something wrong with the floor , everytime we stepped it squeaked
negative	No microwave in the room.the girl in the bar during breakfast doesn't want to help heating up my frozen food which is to be taken away. Regulation she said. OK but only one microwave which is shared among other 100 customers. It's also too much noise. ...and doesn't feel like staying in a hotel at all. Very disappointedLocation is not too bad
negative	They are like a cheater. I will never face such kind for situation in my life to gave the booking thru booking.com. My request pls remove from your list for your better reputation. I will not suggest anybody to stay in this hotel.
negative	Poor service when I complained about being overcharged by 275.00. Beware - this place while the location is good - the customer service/receptionist was most unhelpful.
negative	The hardest mattress i sow in 2 years traveling! I just couldn't sleep at all. Gutters in the bathroom and hard to find (farther away of map location!)The room looks nice, IN PICTURES!
negative	The staff had no clue whats happening and they gave reason as full booking. There was no ironing facility in room. With great difficulty got the board and iron only to be told that finish it in few minutes and keep it outside. Had requested late check out. WHen I came back at 12:30 pm to pick my luggage from room, front office tells me after diy dallying for 25 minutes that already a guest has been put in the room. Valet had parked my car but when I wanted to go out they gave me the key and said please retrieve your car yourself. And no info on where is the car parked could be anywhere in the B1 and B2 the two basements....
negative	No WiFi, they charged me for a triple room instead of a double when we stayed in a double, they wanted me to pay upfront when we hadn't been shown our room, they wanted me to pay by card but then their machine didnt work but kept blaming my card, so I payed cash after using same card to get money out of the atmNothing
negative	When I arrived ,the receptionest told me that the hotel is full except one room which is for disableds. The room was very terrible. After I took a shower, all the room became wet because the water was leaking towards the room. I felt that I rented a swimming pool not a room.The breakfast
negative	-I asked for a non-smoking room and got a smoking one - There was a small tears in the bath robe and some of the towels - Hair stuck to the shower handset -Flavourless breakfast
negative	Bait and switch; nothing that was promised, was delivered. The owner was rude and abusive.Nothing
negative	Felt a bit dirty, the kettle was mouldy, the curtains where also mouldy, the fridge was rusty, it also stopped working which ruined over $60 of food. And we had no cold wine to drink on Christmas Day. For the money we paid I expected more.Good location easy walk to town.
negative	There was a cockroach in my room, and there is a window that opens to a walkway which can be easy access to Room 28 , and this window cannot be locked, the safety was questionable.I like the architecture of the building, I think they could do more in terms of the service... there was a cockroach in my room.
negative	The heater stopped working in the middle of the night we froze and then changed rooms in the morning. Second room the toilet stopped working. Both rooms were stained ripped curtains dirty carpet weird smell. The doors to the hotel kept sticking making it impossible to go in and out. The front desk is so rude they don't even great you when u come in and I've never seen them smile. We have stayed here multiple times because of the comfy bed and big jacuzzi but for the amount of money it is and everything is garbage and dirty and old it is not worth it I'll go somewhere else: the toilet is almost to the ground and pink the place is so outdated.we had enough and checked out a night early and it was our anniversary. Stay awayThe bed is comfy but the pillows were stained and the sheets barley fit and there was a hole between the bed and baseboard
negative	Pool was dirty and the only reason why we booked here. Staff were not flexible for distant travellers and a friend was told one thing and expectations were different.Revocation make it more comfortable but still needs detailed cleaning.
negative	- Booked a room for two days at least one month in advance, however booking got canceled without even receiving any emails. When we got there unknowingly, staff said our booking got cancelled. We had to pay another price which was ridiculous for what it was. - Very terrible toilet and bathroom. Strong smell of bad eggs - Towels were not particularly clean so did the sheet of beds - Not even close to the centre. The hotel is located really in middle of no where - Very poor value for moneyIt's very difficult to think about something I like about the property. Perhaps it was not too small?
negative	I dont like the toilet And i really dont like the towel Its so smelly 3 day im in there But after room service clean my room also my towel still same
negative	I have booked a non smoking room and I got a smoking one. Was strongly stinking and they couldn't give me another room. Slept very bad and even after they did a treatment for the smoke stank to go away it was still awful and difficult to sleep as even the sheets where stinking badly. Sauna small and separate for man and woman.The breakfast was good and various.
negative	Room was so poorly lit that reading was impossible. Breakfast was poor in range and taste. Lobby was badly it and looked badNothing much. Bed was fine. So was TV.
negative	Bed smellyOld design..curtain not coverage full of the window, door hard to lock & open
negative	I expected a lot because of the pictures and the price ( NZD 140,-) I think the pictures on the internet where quite old. The place needs a lot of maintenance. Also cleaning: mold in the shower, dust behind the bedside table and spider webs on the ceiling. Also noisy neighbors that played thumping music. Very low hot water pressure in the shower. Very outdated furniture. The breakfast was ok, but not very nicely served. Pots of jam on the table. Everything would have been acceptable for a price of NZD 45,- not NZD 140,-. I have had much, much better B&B's for NZD 95,- in a nicer place than Westport.The bed was good. Internet ok, failed sometimes.
negative	Every thing Crowded reception with 2 stuff so busy also only 2 lifts for 40 floor long waiting no proper clean water leak at bathroom water sink blocked car parking access not work from 12 to 7 am long waiting to bring the bags u need to park ur car couse the employee so busy windows so dirty half of the lights not working locations only 1 exit and 1 entrance and will take at least 10 min slow drivingUnit size and layout
negative	We felt that this hotel was very over-priced. The furnishings were of poor quality and some were broken. Virtually no water came out out of the shower and the towels were threadbare. The hotel name is also misleading. It was a stone's throw away from the airport but miles from a useable public beach. It was our most disappointing holiday ever!.The view from the veranda was beautiful
negative	Very old and unsafe. Anyone can walk in off the street. We made reservations months in advance for a double or queen room. They put us in a twin room after they charged our credit card for our 2 week stay. Virtually no service a front desk. Restaurant opened when it wanted. Horrible place. We checked out 2 days earlyNothing
negative	the bed, the room was too cold, even after using the AC which was not functioning properly. too small rooms for double, bath is too smallnothing
negative	The towels looks like were from year 1990. The white towels looked black and smells awful. Bed is like sleeping on metal. AC okay. Beware of water dripping from the AC. The rooms are okay but lots of noise if anyone outside. No soundproof. Prepare yourself to be awaken in middle of night in case your neighbour is checking out especially if they are eastern european/russians who speaks loudly. Breakfast is very very basic.Location
negative	Carpets stinks.. Heaters dont work.. Hot water is not even luke warm.. Free water tap in the reception doesnt work. They have every thing visible. But nothing works. Thats the speciality of the hotel. Showers are so tiny that you cant even move inside it if you are tall person. This place is just like a lugguage storage place. Don't expect much. To add icing there will be a rude asian guy in the reception busy playing with his phone and really gets upset if you ask any thing while he is playing.Location
negative	The Casablanca Room on the first floor is not something u should book. The room is very cold, the aircon is out of order. The drainer is not good. U will get the hot water for only 5 minutter then it is stopped!! The pillow and bedsheet is dirty. So u need to decise for yourselv whether it is worth of your money only with good location!!The hotel is located in a very good location, not far from the old town and the local market. Breakfast is bread and jam with your choice either coffe or tea. Do not expect frech juice her. The staff is froendly😊
negative	Spring porking bed , expensive, staff manners li did not lukeParticularly I can't say anything that I like
negative	The bed was horrible i felt every spring, the floor was dirty , it smelled , the room was supposed to be a bungalow on the ocean it was a room above the restaurant. loud, no hot water, staff was rude.tulum is amazing
negative	The corridors are dark and the rooms are damp. the overall atmosphere and cleanliness of the hotel and the room needs to improveThe hotel was located within walking distance to all facilities, attractions and main transport networks. This made moving around simple. It serves good breakfast and the staff was accommodating to the fact that I was Vegan. On the other hand the room was cold and damp. The bed I requested was a double instead of twins and when I requested a larger duvet, though the staff responded promptly but the duvet had horrible stains. I definitely did not enjoy my night's sleep. It felt dark, damp and unclean
negative	The fact that the shower and bathroom of No 15 was so dirty we could not bring ourselves to use is.Nothing I am afraid, The brochure is false advertising
negative	Run down motel, no WiFi, disgruntled owner saying check in is only at 2 & complaining my check in time at 11. Nosey, wanted to know why I was there. The walls are paper thin & you can hear everything in the next rooms. The shower is 2 feet from the bed inside the bedroom, the toilet is inside a small closet space, I don't think a 300lbs person could be able to use it. No closet. Needs major reno.Nothing
negative	The room was dirty..tissue on floor in bathroom sink was filled with dirty water..duvet was smaller than the bedsheet so most of the night on the side I slept on I just had a sheet to sleep with and no duvet. Would not stay here again. I wouldn't class this as the Hilton more of a hostel
negative	Staffs not accommdodating except the guard that does a very good job even doing what bellboy should do. The rooms needs renovations as well as the swimming pool.Only bathroom is good, the rest are really bad and needs replacement or renovation.
negative	the room and the bed was awful. worst than awful. I will never refer this hotel to anyone. worst is that the guy in charge was irritating and need lots of formation.anything was good. worst hotel I have visited in my entire life
negative	Room are too small. Ventilation is very poor, can say its non existent. V come family of 10pax, one got flu virus and transmited to 6 of us. Air quality too bad.Nothing
negative	No elevator , room is very small , toielt also .Nothing
negative	the staff are rude, not experienced and qualified. They keep telling you if you book through us we give you discount through booking. com no discounts no breakfasts. Very expensive seasonally not worth the price. you have to pay for the slipper room even when they did not provide me with a clean floor room they asked for money very cheap service. Ample question; I asked for super market number that delivers to their hotel. a woman respond was we don't have anyone delivers to our hotel i don't know and hang up. i found minimum 3 that delivers to their hotel after searching and wasting my time. they could have simple things done to improve but 2 stars give them an excuse for any behaviour how ever the price was for 4 stars hotel!location
negative	Old beds, mattresses, sheets towels. No care taken to improve guests basics. Damp smelly and cold showers. Mosquitoes but no Mosquito killers. Many home stays you could see were trying to improve but this one didn't seem to care.Nothing Really
negative	The room on the ground floor was dirty, dark and smelly: lot of dust on the furniture, big tuft of hair on the armchair, gray blankets - supposed to be white. The lady owner said sorry at every complaint but things remained unchanged. Breakfast (2 dollars!!) was served on a small, dirty table placed in the hall: coffee was cold and served in soiled glasses, we asked for omelette and we received scrambled eggs with lots of onions (but I have to say that after complaint we receive a real omelette - quite oily). Taxi service (to be honest, a private car) to the airport was more expensive than outside. Few days later the lady contacted me in order to blame us of having broken the power key: she didn't ask for money but she demanded that we cancel the reservation on booking in order not to pay commissions! At the end, I cannot understand so many good opinions from former guests.Not bad position
negative	Very unacceptable for the price. No hot water in our room, no wifi, the pools weren't clean, if you did want to jump in. The security gaurds were not going to secure much after dark, as they were baracho by sundown. Then to top this whole hotel experience off, our friend got the suite, which was anything but sweet. First it was near the basement, second the room was pretty much the same as ours except for the hot tub, which had trash and dirt in it. And again no hot water. Will not be staying here again.
negative	A bed that fitted two normal sized people 12s .Toilet that worked sink with plug that worked.Carpet in corridor that needed cleaning of excrement but saff to busy talking to clean .Breakfast no cold milk juicer that said orange but gave pineapple no tea bags and food of poor qualityOnly the shower was good .the girl Rachel was help full .I have really nothing to say that was good
negative	Paid $1570 for 3 nights, rooms weren't serviced during the stay, had to go downstairs to get a new set of towels. Pictures made room & balcony look bigger. Was charged $150 for leaving empty smoke packet on balconyLocation
negative	The rooms don't have any central heating... not a good place to stay in winter. The staff decided to take all of our things and pack them for us when we went out for the morning so they could show the room to someone else. They were very rude and not at all accommodating.In the heart of Lisbon... great location.
negative	Very very very bad experience! The images on booking.com are not the same as the reality! 2 stars is maximum for this hotel. It's an old one but they could do proper renovation & cleaning. At least booking.com should have mentioned that the hotel is not fresh or needs renovation. Terrible!!
negative	The room are very small. Carpet in corridor dirty. The front desk staff not very friendly. Expeditive to do check in.The location was great. The breakfast was acceptable. The tv good size.
negative	There wasnt much to like. They were doing really really loud construction next foor and on the unit directley above from 7am to about 5:30 or 6 pm. I stayed up almost all of the night and didnt go to bed until 6 am or soright after I went to sleep super loud construction resumed at 11:30 or so it stopped and I was able to go to sleep. Then the noise started again. By 1:30 I couldnt take it any more and went down to the front desk and told them I needed to move or find a new hotel. They didnt have any open rooms away from the construction. They wanted to charge an extra day, for the late checkout.
negative	Staff totally not competent 1. Do not speak English or Mandarin (only in local dialect) 2. Concierge not able to recommend sightseeing places or restaurants 3. Late checkout agreed at 2.00 pm when check-in but front desk did not register this. They called us ~12.30 pm on our departure day when we were still sleeping 4. The plastic holder in the shower (for holding soap / toiletries) fell down when I was in the shower.Bed is good Room is clean
negative	Not very welcoming, not good for families, complimentary things has to be requested first instead of providing upon check-in, no towels provided in the pool area, very strict and expensive, they care more about money instead of their guest needs. Staff should know how to smile.Nothing.
negative	The water was cold in shower no hot water when we arrive we take long time to finish the booking Ac was hot and the room was to much small I don't like our stayI don't like the room at all
negative	The host was hard to get hold of. The staff present were friendly but no English. Loud music was played through late hours and we couldn't sleep. The shared toilets and shower were disgusting. After asking for a vegan breakfast (of even just fruit) we were served eggs and sausages, and white toast with jam and cream. We had to ask for fruit and the serving was very little. This was not the staff fault as their English was limited, but the host did assure us this would be no problem. This room is 4 walls with a bed and lots of ants, so you're better off paying much less and opting for a tent which also has a bed, power and lights. There was very little information on white water rafting and I felt we were bothering the host every time we asked about it. Overall very overpriced and not 2 planned nights became one.The camp is just by a running river which was the only beautiful thing about it. We loved walking through this and sitting on the rocks in the middle of it.
negative	No heat in 29 degree weather, cable for TV hanging from the ceiling so you will need to BYOTV! Door knob about to fall off the door. Room stinks 😷!Nothing
negative	Room was disgusting, plug sockets falling off the wall! Tap on the sink was falling off and no hot water in the shower! Just had to sit on the bed for it to make a noise and the heating didn't work and just made a banging sound all threw the night! The paper thin walls also means you are awake at 6am!!Hotel was in a convenient location
negative	Nothing booking .com it self is cheating online showed kingbed but given queen bed and not shown 25k but charged 31k I suggest goibibo is best app and reliable oneLocation is good
negative	It was quite dirty, even by average hostel standards. The floor wasn't close to clean and forget the toilets. The bunk beds were terrible - the top bunk was much too high and climbing up and down was seriously a pain and could be dangerous. I've been to a lot of hostels and this is by far the worst one.There is a 24hr supermarket right across the street and a reasonably-priced restaurant below
negative	The staff is despicable. You can feel all along that they are just after your money : not caring, smiling. The only time the owner say hi to us was when we were about to leave and I wanted to sell us a shuttle to leave the city. The girl at the reception seems completely lost and is always pouting. The breakfast is ridiculous : the two tiniest toast you have ever had ( so thin that it is closed to be transparent). If you it this you will be starving after. When I ask if it was possible to have one more toast the girl that does the reception and the breakfast looked at me and did the "money sign" with her finger telling me "yes, extra, extra, extra toast, extra money" (we were the only customer and it was the first we saw her smiling). I discovered so many beautiful and caring staff since we arrived in Bali, these one really don't deserve you to stay in their place. They are rude and impolite.
negative	1-Breakfast is acceptable for 2 star hotel 2- staff were not proficional they gave me missleading information 3 times and they don't know the area well. 3- They charge me more than the price that in the booking.comthey room good size, but noisy on the main street, and not clean.
negative	People working here are really not Nice, they show you that they dont want to help you each time you dare talk to them... We went in 4 different rooms, all of them stink so much, sheets are dirty, wifi doesn't work... Dont come here.Almost nothing
negative	Place was dirty, filthy windows and sliding doors. Filthy stained couches. Didn't even sit on them, horrible. Place was huge like a rabbit warren. Some cottages where just in bare dry patches of earth, no trees or shrubs. Ours had nice native trees and shrubs but some where horrible.The bed
negative	Rude personnell which try to rip you off, dirty rooms, not soundproofed at allNothing
negative	We came there and they told us they donot have any free rooms, but we had confirmed reservation...finally they solved it somehow, but I have no idea how. I guess they canceled other reservation...big chaoz. We wanted to wash our clothes, but they forgot to take our clothes to laundry...fail...Do not recommend at all...Only location...
negative	Plenty of things. (Missing food item on the fridge is being asked on us upon check out) we didnt consume anything.Bed is ok, but tv is not on good viewing position, its not even working nobody attended upon informing the reception that tv is faulty. No slippers, no kettle for hot water, coffee cup not readily available. Wifi too is not working. Parking is not available. Toilet sink is dirty with stain.
negative	They have a nice advertisement, but it does not come with substance: they have a pool on the roof, but there is no a lifeguard; they have a gym, but it became a storage room already; there is a restaurant next to the hotel, but they have the worst food I have ever eaten in DubaiLocation was a good one, but being next to a metro station was quite noisy. Hotel personnel are very nice people, but they forget easily what you ask for. So, you have to remind them about your request.
negative	Cold shower No working internet Very rude and unhelpful reception staff Noisy with motor bikes , bars and thin walls! Balcony looked to my wall The front doors didn't close unless you slammed once or twice - so when everyone else did that you woke up and it's annoying! The pillows are like breeze blocks I moved out the following am!Nothing at all! The rooms were a decent size
negative	Very very Rude staff location is the roughest place in Dublin
negative	The floor had just had carpet lying ontop of uneven concrete. I stumped my toe and broke my nail on the first day so i kept my shoes on for the remainder of my stay. very dissapointing rooms.The staff were very polite.
negative	No hot water, no coffee, closed dirty pool, horrible staff!!Nice view and that's it!
negative	1. The room was not as per photos. Very small. 2. The toilet had broken shower hold and water dripping from the toilet ceiling 3. Water heater only gave temporary hot water 4. There were no carpets in the unit at all for a cold location such as genting. (Other hotels have carpets, even if it's not cold) 5. Staff could not guide where best to park car and we got lost a lot of times going and leaving the hotel room to find car park. 6. Staff should learn how to acknowledge guests and smile more. Overall, unpleasant stay for a RM700++ per night stay. We thought the photos in their website DID NOT DO JUSTICE as I believed the price I was willing to pay was ok for such ['false'] photos.Nothing.
negative	Dirty hotel, very old, nothing in food menu, very bad.Nothing to be liked, from staff to food, very bad.
negative	Thee way they traying to take more mony from gust by anywayBad hotel they trays to take any mony from gust they charge me for wifi very high charge also they ssked me to pay extra charge for my child bed and breakfast but I refused to pay
negative	I want to raise a complaint against Eureka Hotel stay with regards to this booking. 1. Assigned room was supposed to non smoking and upon arrival they said its not a available. 2. Bathroom had bugs 3. Room smelled and stinked very funny and sour 4. Walls were old and needed of painting badly Everything else was rusty and sticky. 5. No airport shuttle provide NOTHING WAS PROVIDED AS REQUIRED, WHATS GOING ON?!?!? THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND UNPROFESSIONAL FOR BOOKING.COM?? THERE WAS A 2 YR OLD KID INVOLVED IN ALL THIS PLS DONT MAKE BLOG ABOUT THIS. Kindly provide compensation or refund APPROPRIATELY AND IMMEDIATELY.Nothing , nothing is there to talk good about this Hotel stay.
negative	EverythingDid not like anything place had to offer
negative	No tv. No instructions how to access my free wifi. No cutlery around for people like me who forgot to get some from the resteraunt Bed was hard and uncomfortable. Room had no fridge or condiments.Thai nearby was good.
negative	The room was freezing very run down,needed to be cleaned was damp.room was furtherist from reception.was obvious on checking out we had been in an older room less used damp smelling . Compared to fresh rooms we saw leavingLocation
negative	The room was small and musty. Only 2 small towels to use. Bed was uncomfortable with only 2 pillows. Very noisy neighbours next door. The staff on arrival were very rude. I'm very disappointed and will never stay again. Will definitely not be recommending you to my friends and familyTo be honest the only thing I liked was the view, which I had to pay extra for
negative	The cleaners are not friendly, not smiling & shouting to me, also when i try to ask for ice the operator shouted on me because i fully up three times already and no one is coming up to give me what i order
negative	the worst hotel EVER. Bad isolation with a lot of noice outside and inside. I cannot understand how this hotel could have this ranking. Are we sure about the rerviews? It is crazy 50 $ the night cannot justify a such poor roomrestaurant was nice
negative	There was a night club directly across from the hotel which was incredibly noisy (loud music.) Could not sleep at all until they quit. The staff failed to tell us about this noise. When we switched from a standard room to a suite, they should have mentioned that the windows faced the night club and it was really noisy. Overall, the staff was not helpful. I would not recommend this hotel to anybody.Decor was cute
negative	All facilities very poor, WiFi don't work properly, we booked this hotel because of ski to door access, but it was only for kids 3-5 age of old with unfortunately only artificial snow, breakfast very very poor, we had 3 bed room suite - beds completely uncomfortable, there was no double bed at all just single beds jointed and constantly parted,nothing
negative	No fridge in the room, you could feel the gap between the two mattresses the put together, heating never worked so froze both nights.The room was a decent size, nice view aswell
negative	We saw a bottomless man wandering in the corridor. The light in the female shower room would shut out after 20 mins and would take another 10 mins to be activated again.Cheap
negative	Everything: Bad food Bad Staff Horrible rooms Very bad design of the rooms Leaking showers that flood the washrooms Extremely cold rooms that make you shiver The hotel looks like an apartment Noise flows through and even when someone flushes toilet, closes the door or moves anything in the room above. It rains a lot but the hotel is so poorly designed that you would get wet when going to their restaurant.Location
negative	1. Front desk personnel is rude. 2. Room is freezing cold. Heating is almost non existent. 3. Wall between rooms is so thin we hear sounds from the next room we're not supposed to hear. 4. WiFi signal in rooms are non existent.Nothing in this hotel can be liked except aside from its proximity to Grand Place. Nothing.
negative	The rooms were not carpeted and in a hill station like Genting you expect the place to be cosy. The water heaters were not working and the lift access was not secure. The whole experience was very bad.The heated pool was good
negative	Worst experience I had in my life, dirty, noisy, with horrible breakfast, but the apogee is that when I checked out and was in a big hurry to get to the airport, the persons who work in the reception, told me that I have to pay for drinks in the mini bar that I didn't consume, though I tried to explain that I didn't take anything from mini bar, they where talking something in Turkish (that I don't understand), and trying to convince me that I did consume drinks from their mini bar, after about 15 minutes (it was about 05:30 in the morning) because the taxi was waiting for me to long, and I needed badly to the airport, I paid for the drinks and exit this horrible place, they took the money without printing any receipt. If you don't want to have same experience as mine, I advice everybody to choose another place to live in Istanbul.Good location only, the rest is horrible.
negative	The staff took awhile to validate my online booking. Aircon took so long to make the room comfortably cool. The towels look old and dirty. The room service staff said we can charge the food we ordered to the room but after awhile called to say we have to pay at once. The parking space is too cramped.The price and location.
negative	no air conditioner, room very hot, not even a fan on ceiling to cool room, very small room, yes I know I only paid $120 per night but I expected air conditioning, was told when I rang to complain that they say on website that there is no air conditioning but I have read the information many times and still can see no reference of no air conditioning in the room. Bed very uncomfortable. Its a dorm room not a Motel Room. Very disappointedclose to SCG that's about it.
negative	rooms dirty , staff doesn't' care, everything was slow also the check out, they request the payment in advance even if you book late paymentnothing
negative	Tons of mosquitoes in room. Bathroom so tiny that taking shower got toilet and entire floor wet. No restaurant on site. Noisy due to central city location. Not sure how it got 8.3 ratings from others on your site but we felt misled by the rating when we experienced the hotel for ourselvesRelatively clean
negative	The hotel is just not worth that much moneyThe view is nice
negative	Far from airport, super small and stuffy room, lack of necessary facilities, low cost-effectivenessQuiet
negative	Internet was rubbish, bars / clubs not very good / over prices 15 AED for water when it's 1.50 outside.. Poor experience same feedback from other residents Very noisy hotelPlace is very noisy, bars and clubs in the hotel are not very good. Door staff and room cleaning staff are very good. Internet is very poor for Dubai, very disappointed kept crashing. Cafe next to reception kept directing people to the restaurants. Location not bad close to strip but not so many decent restaurants on the strip. Would not book this again, spoke to other residents who said this is one of the worst hotels in Dubai.
negative	No balcony like booking.com said!! Cats everywhere...no working fridge, broken waterpump,water was turned off!! I lasted one night, then moved.The staff were good, the place was disgusting!!Wifi in room.
negative	- Staff behavior - When I checked-in, there was no water in the hotel for more than 7 hours. Its horrible! - The hotel manager is so lame, that the room I booked from Booking.com, they given me a completely different crap room with low light, dirty furniture. After series of scolding, they had to change my room- Location of the hotel is good - Breakfast is good too
negative	The place was a lot dirtier then the images depicted. The Gym/spa area looked and felt unsanitary. None of the staff were very helpful except for the bell desk guy that helped with luggage.
negative	Front desk- they dont even smile and not too welcoming. Rooms-very small. No mugs for coffee but there's a kettle. No table/desk to put some Food. No couch or even a chair. No cabinet at all. Very small lobby.Location. Near city bus stops. Metro is a bit far. 12 mins walk. Not Good if you are with children.
negative	Front desk his name TrinoTerribly I asked for the manager and the front desk just smile, bad actitud..just terribly.
negative	Very unfriendly staff, too many stairs for some rooms," and no internet signal.Is far enough from the centre. They clean the room everyday 
negative	There was no wifi. The walls are so thin we were kept up by loud music played by other guests and guests walking in the corridor. Very disappointing considering the price we paid!The breakfast and state of the rooms was very good.
negative	EverythingThis hotel was more a two star no jacuzzi working
negative	run down area awful rooms need of decoration bathroom had loose and mouldy tiles hand rail hanging off wall and hand basin cracked no toiletries.paint coming off walls safe not working they even had the tv remote control tied to bedside table. breakfast not good bad service and lack of hygiene.would not recommend this hotel to anyoneclose to centre
negative	The room service was not provided in one day. Restaurant's choices are very limited and not diversified. Extremely expensive for its service and restaurant.
negative	Photos gave false impression . Very small , uncomfortable . Ruined my night . Nothing on site about dorm room and shared lounge smelled of food and messy couldn't even enjoy viewPhotos gave false impression . Very small , uncomfortable . Ruined my night . Nothing on site about dorm room and shared lounge smelled food and messy couldn't even enjoy view
negative	No wifi, impatient staff, inability to get a taxi at 05:00 to the airport and nearly missing my flightClose to city center
negative	$35 a night for a fan Only room and a bathroom under construction/demolition is a joke. The one meal I had was awful.Nothing positive to say about this dump. Too far from Otres beach action so fair game to be gouged by the local Tuk Tuk drivers
negative	The photos of the rooms were greatly misleading, the rooms were cramped and stuffy, there was no fridge in the room and it was a $40 cab ride to get anywhere, all in all it was as good as throwing money into a trash canNothing at all
negative	Old facilities; old matress, old carpet. Poor breakfast. Not clean breakfast. High rate of local tel. calls (3 QR /min for local calls in Doha; ooredoo charge 0.5 QR/min for intenational calls).Location is good. I have booked for 2-bed room unit and they offered me 3-bed room unit.
negative	The floor in the room was sticky and dirty. It is smelly in the room. Linen sheet is dirty too. Poor services!!!!great location
negative	Dirty and smelly place and very bad customer service
negative	Mold, leaky faucet, smelly beds, musty oder, rooted floor, no tv remote. This experience was absolutely terrible. Every thing in the room was falling apart. The bath shower/tub faucet ran all night and could not be turned all the way off. The bathroom wall and floor around tub was rotten from continue water damage. In one place you can fall thru the floor if not careful. The bed mattresses all had rips and stains. The place smelled like mold and was really musty due to water damage. I was very disappointed, but it was already late and I was very tired from long drive, so I endured until around 5am (We arrived around 12am) got up and left. Never again will I stay at Knights Inn.
negative	The lady on reception was rude and very unhelpful; not only to us, but to others whilst we were waiting to be checked in. The hotel room was far from what the specifications stated it to be, there were dried blood patches on the sheets, the shower facilities weren't the best and the room was so small, we struggled to make our way around the bed (our double room was drastically smaller than their economy double, a room that's supposedly not as higher spec). Also, the only option was to struggle with a heavy case 4 flights of steep narrow stairs to get to the room, as the lift was not working. I can imagine for some people, they would have had a real problem accessing their accommodation. Finally, the cost; a rip off for what we received. The night before and after we were in Bruges for a fraction of the price, and we stayed in the cleanest, friendliest hotel; a far cry from this hostel style accommodationI can't say there was anything I liked about the place
negative	We arrived 1 am (night time) to the hotel, and the receptionist told us with poor english that we cant stay in the hotel, eventhough we have booked rooms for 2 nights. The reason was that no foreigners can stay in this hotel, and apparently police had something to do with that?! So we had to go on the street in the middle of the night and try to find another hotel. We still dont understand how this is possible!
negative	My bathtub every shower would remain full of water up past ankles it was disgusting lining the tub with some dirt and hair.made me sick to my stomach considering I've never paid almost $500 for two nights in Niagara ever! My husband who I've been separated from and we went away to try and rekindle our love forgot his ring on the bed we called back once out of town and it was the same maid both days.. but nope his ring was gone and she said she never seen it... very dishonest staff very disappointed in that! Will never ever stay there again! Horrible experience only nice thing was our veiw of falls. We took our daughter swimming and when we went to get out no towels there for guests I had to walk dripping wet to front desk wait for the staff to finish signing in guests to ask to have towels to the pool area... big disappoint too was no fridge in room
negative	catastrophic nothing worse breakfast I have experienced cold in the room very cold inability to control room operated Centralia
negative	Everything except the building it selfThe customer service was terrible. Breakfast was not included. The manager was never available to hear a complaint. The bed was uncomfortable and painful to sleep in. The building was deteriorated. I don't recommend this stablishment. Very disappointed. There's hidden fees.
negative	Room was very small. Bath room is very much small. Staff was rude and they didn't clean the rooms as well. General manager was highly unprofessional and rude.Nothing much
negative	-NO value for money -tiny, cell-like rooms -paperthin walls - very loud -wifi doesn't work in the room -no facilities on the top floor, only one toilet on first floor and two showers and a toilet on the ground floor -breakfast at the hotel next door very expensive and basic -floors&carpets &walls&curtains& towels dirty and ancient -only one socket in the room -very unfriendly&rude receptionist - asked for recommendations for activities and restaurants, she couldn't be bothered with a nice answer, only handed me a map
negative	Stayed night 7 January. Have been in hotels all over Ireland and over the world and that hotel worst one I have ever stay in. The room very small , carpets dirty and staines over. Bathroom dirty and filty, shower broke, drain bloked. Door saddle its extremely dirty. Room dusty. Table light didnt work and hair dryer not work. Outside window ventilation fan from kitchen-noise all night. Terribly!!!!Location
negative	Every morning from 10 am to 11 there was a noisy sound we talk to the reception and they send a technician and thay fixed the A C and the sounds go the next day it comes again !!! The other thing. In the last day the luggage man by mistaken het the coffee cup with my son bag. The coffee pour in the floor and my son bag i said nevermind it's happen accidentally but the problem after my chic out the hotel send my an email that they will charge me foor the accident !!!! Some of my child new clothes dirty becouse of the bill man and i gived him a tip now they send my an email they want to charge me !!Near the mall
negative	The smell of drains in the bathroom The mould in the shower The shoebox size room The double bed which could only be described as a single The green exit light which had to be covered up to get to sleep You could hear next door guests going to the toilet Located next to hostels down a side street giving an unsafe vibeNothing
negative	Water not hot. Bed linen not changed and hair in bathroom .Loved location.
negative	There was a kettle in the room, but no cups, tea,coffee. Quite a lot of outside noise - dogs barking in neighbouring properties into the early hours, followed by building site noise from 7am. The lane leading to the property wasn't in a good state, especially after it rained. Never saw any signs of food being available at the property and could see no signs of an on-site restaurant either. Not especially good value for money when compared to other similarly priced hotels I stayed in on my trip - their rooms had daily fresh bottled water, a fridge and a TV. Would certainly think twice about booking here again.The staff were friendly and helpful
negative	The bed was infested with bedbugs. I was severely bitten. Disgusting and filthy. Co- owner/ manager was extremely rude. Hotel was not hygienic nor clean. Towels were small and a dirty grey colourClose to Gare De Noord
negative	1. Bed sheet/covers everything stings and smelly 2. Room flooring carpet not even cleaned or vaccumed 3. toilet don't even have door mat 4. no room slippers at all 5. air con system extremely cold even if switched off. 6. Water heater only 3mins hot then cold all the way 7. Wifi sucks always disconnecting. 8. Front desk personal inexperienced.Nothing at all everything sucks.
negative	Property is dated. Staff appear uninterested, when you could find them. Room was old and not well cleaned. Food expensive and not worth the money. It was a disappointing experience. would never stay there again.Not much.
negative	Room was dirty and smelly. Air Conditioning barely working, room was very hot. We called but were told system was OK. Room was so hot we decided to sleep in another hotel the next night even if we had paid for room. No bathroom towels when we got to our room, had to wait one hour for delivery. Maid entered our room on numerous occasion unannounced. This is substandard for this type of hotel.Desk staff were helpful with visit and tickets.
negative	No rest. or bar. food and beach to far away.Still lots of huracane damage.
negative	This hotel was by far the most ghettoest place I've stayed in a long time no wonder it was only $35 a night you asked for a non-smoking room but the stench of cigarettes smacks you in the face as soon as you open the door and I'm not quite sure what the weird stuff was on the couch or why the comforters smelled so odd but once again $35 a night you kind of get what you pay forThe price...the tv
negative	Bed was uncomfortable, bed sheets were stained, floor dirty, room smelt of egg and quality was very poorDidn't really like anything as hotel was generally dirty and uncomfortable for duration of stay
negative	Horrible hotel! I do not recommend anybody to stay in! Staff is not friendly..looks suspicious, . It is not safe at all., I lost a lot of money, while I was outside, someone opened my luggage,. I complaint, to manager, and he said nobody entered to my room, because I carried the key with me...Also, the room, is in bad condition: bathroom door un broken a hole in the door, and the room ceiling.,I took a lot of pictures.. they even clean my bedroom, when I complaint, the the guy at front desk, said I carried the key with me, so that's an excuse if something happens, that's was my false. Not telephone inside the room., last night, not cable...I didn't sleep, because, the incident about luggage and my money.. and worried if something bad happens to me. Please, remove this hotel, from your page, I don't want anybody passed for the same situation..Location,,
negative	The photos paint a more luxurious picture than is the reality of staying at the Villa. While the location on the river is nice, the quality of the rooms did not deliver. There were ants across tables and benches, towels were non absorbent and the bathrooms were seedy. There was no air conditioning and we could not lock the door of our villa without assistance from staff every time.River front location nice.
negative	The staff are rude and very unhelpfulWell early check in was a problem And we had to leave for breakfast early and asked could they leave some bread out or requests weren't met , the staff were horrible
negative	The whole room looked not clean, shower curtain was dirty, sheets needed to be renewed. The shower was not working. The traffic noise was bad during sleeping time. Internet/wifi worked only the first day.The staff was friendly.
negative	When I was there, the TV in the hotel room was broken, informed to the front desk, but they told me there is no technician at that time. I end up my night without TV. The way staff answered me quite arrogant. Yellowish bed sheet, itchy and uncomfortable. Water heater adjuster also not in good condition. Not worth for money. Luckily just for one night stay.
negative	Hotel was very tired and our room not very clean and exposed pipes and messed up light fixtures. Under the bathroom vanity was dirty and empty. The whole property needs uodating.
negative	Dirty towels smelled like burnt linens, no cable tv, old outdated furniture with carved names and graffiti on it. Also the carpet was filthy. Didn't see any bugs but maybe it was too coldClose to attractions
negative	A tourist trap. Overpriced, a bus load of tourists comes everyday. The food is mediocre. And the surroundings are average, with screaming kids running around. Worst of all, we paid 190 USD for a 3 hour safari. We saw peacocks and squirrels. If you're looking to go on a safari, choose other parks. Avoid at all cost.
negative	Staff is horrible and rude. They took money from my credit card and later they wanted also cash from me. Of course they promised that they gonna give money on credit card back but they never did
negative	Staff - price - room - service - location - noise - cleanness - bathroom - no warm water - there is nothing to like at that placeNothing - scandalous - aggressive staff - cheating - not worthy to have a place with a bed because I cannot use the word hotel
negative	It's been a while that this place has had some maintenance or investment in it's buildings or facilities. It's falling apart and it's a disgrace that they still receive guests.Location
negative	The hotel I'd dirty . No swimming pool .. the food very poor. Lack of Adminsrartion... No smilling staff The facilities in the room very. PoorThe only thing I like is the location of the hotel.
negative	DIRTY TV not working Late in airport pickup no one at check in
negative	The room (room 2) was small, the bathroom extremely small, with a half size bath. It was impossible to take a bath as there was no plug. The bracket for the shower head was fixed to the wall at the level of my midriff, but it was loose anyway and did not hold the shower head. THe button press on the toilet cistern also came off as soon as I tried to use it. There was a fusty smell in the bathroom. The self service breakfast was sparse with little choice. The bed was small and not comfortable/lumpy. All round, very poor value.The secure parking
negative	Room was very stinkySecurity was good. He handed over the charger when i left the room
negative	Horrible experience with overflowing toilet! And extremely bad response from the staff and as well the owner!! Even after the compliant we were given just 20% discount !! Extremely disappointed and had a nightmare with the bathroom! Will never in my life refer this hotelNothing which I liked
negative	There was no hot water in two showers which is utterly disgraceful. This meant using approximately eight flights of stairs to access another shower in the other side of the hotel on the second day where there was hot water after asking a member of staff. There were never any staff around when you needed them. Carrying cases up three flights of really narrow stairs was a turn-off. No extra blankets in rooms again no staff when you needed them. There was also considerable noise from one room nearby on the Saturday night until the early hours despite notices asking for respect in terms of noise. Again, no staff on site anywhere to be seen. The bed was not comfortable. Parking, as always in the UK is a major hurdle. In Brighton it is an impossibility. P Warren
negative	A few things were really bad to be fairRoom flooded they only booked us 2 days not 3 got left in another country to find somewhere else to stay on my birthday it's been horrible cleaner in my room 4 times a day from 6 am rediculous and discusting staff
negative	management doesn't want to solve issues,problems etc. not very clean room. facility like spa, pool doesn't allowed for kids. room doesn't have window, between bath and room - no door.location
negative	The hotel was very disappointing for the price. The rooms were freezing cold, carpets very dirty and there was no hot water for a shower on the morning. When I rang reception regarding this she said she would let the manager know. By 12 midday there was still no hot water and no update/apology at all. The rooms were very noisey due to the location which we had accepted prior to travelling, the road sweepers woke us at 6.30am. One of our rooms had a mattress that sank in the middle by a good 4 or 5 inches and the quilt cover was stained. Bathrooms were very tired and needed the grout cleaning around the shower. Breakfast was passable only and really not worth the extra charge. No choice though re type of eggs, it was what it was. And it was basic.The location was amazing, overlooking the river and right in the heart of temple bar. If your travelling to Dublin to sightsee though, I would avoid! The pub and nightclub were very good.
negative	This hotel is a fraud. When I booked it from booking, it says that they have shuttle to Don Muang airport, which is a totally lie. They don't have shuttle service. What they called shuttle service is calling an unofficial taxi for you, which is insanely expensive. The hotel to airport is only 5KM, but the taxi driver charged us 500 thb, which should be less than 50 thb normally. Because our flight is pretty early, we can't find other taxi by ourselves at all. I guess that the driver has connection with the hotel to take advantage of the guests. And the faculties are the worst. Thailand is a country with smiles always, but I didn't see any smile from them in my whole stay, especially the reception in the front desk is the worst. Her attitude to guests was so bad. Again, don't stay in this hotel. And, how can I ask refund from booking?Nothing.
negative	Room very dirty and services do not adequate to a five stars hotel (also the price of the room it is very high)Good Location 
negative	On the last two days of our stay there was no hot water in the shower. Also the room AC filter was FILTHY and had to be cleaned along with the AC unit. They also spray these rooms with a deodorizer that many people are allergic too. There is no complementary hot coffee and tea at this hotel. This is a bare minimum service hotel - Not worth the money. I very seldom complain but I need to let other people know there are better hotels in the area.
negative	Could not check in as time is 12 30 before that they do not entertain anyone and waiting till 12 30 would waste half day
negative	Room was filthy- aircon duct thick with dust, toilet bowl was brown on arrival, sheets didn't smell clean. Very basic rooms and facilities. The food at the buffet breakfast was disgusting. We stayed for one night then moved to another hotel. Maybe accom for students or anyone on a very tight budget. Otherwise wouldn't recommend.Location was ok. Reasonably close to shops and Coles / Woolworths.
negative	The apartment near the street noisy and no view . There was no way at booking time to select apartment exposition, and levelClose to city center and ski area for kids
negative	Not much next to airfield, planes nearly landing on the roof of our room!!!
negative	The management does not know how to deal with clients. Up to 5 times per day I had to ask for the key replacement as it did not work, and it was for more than a month daily. I asked them to keep my car for some days in the parking cause I had to travel and they deny it, with so many spaces as they had it. They have lost a client.The cleaning staff is friendly and they do properly the job. They are the big deal of the hotel.
negative	As a solo traveller mostly staying in dorms I decided to spend a bit more for accommodation on the beach.... Sand outside the front door is not a beach... By showing the location incorrectly every guest is arriving already disappointed. There is nothing immediately around the accommodation and the path to the actual bars on the beach is not lit. The guesthouse had not been cleaned when I arrived late afternoon, and while the staff were very quick to resolve it, it overall didn't feel like good value for money, especially after seeing actual beach front accommodation nearby for less money.Staff were very friendly
negative	Just mentionned above. I will make sure the entire expat community of Sri Lanka is aware of the noisy, unpleasant atmosphere waiting for them there. For not less than a usd 100 per night!!! ScandaleousVery average hotel and terrible location next to a bar making a lot of noise with people half or totally drunk after lunch time onward. Ridiculous!
negative	This is a cheap motel and not a service apartment.NEVER ! NEVER ! use carpet in rooms . It smell like a wet dog is living in the apartment. The surrounding area is next to a youth hostel, however you will see drunks and destitute along the pathway and it gets scary at night to walk around to a convenient store. The bathroom sink is stain and ventilation is poor. Carpets is stained and very very dirty.Low price.
negative	It was cramped and cold. Felt like a dive. It was so cold we couldn't get warm and our door wouldn't close properly without a curtain being in the way. No amenities, although cose in proximity to a lot in Calgary.The kids liked the pool
negative	Slept on thin mattress on pallets 6 inches off unfinished concrete floor, under the sundeck .mosquito netting was to catch dust and dirt falling through. Smelled like the sewer It was musty and moldy.you could see the mold and I did have a reaction. My clothes still smell of the place.Nothing,worst hostel in 8.5 weeks of hostels
negative	Beds and pillows were extremely hard and uncomfortable. The temperature in letterkenny was minus degrees and snowing however when you went into your room there was no heating on and you had to set you temperature yourself on arrival. The hotel hallways etc were cold. There were smashed tiles in the bathroom. The toilet in the room was stained. The room was noisy could here very clearly people outside the hotel and in other rooms especially at night time.Staff were accommodating.
negative	Failed to clean room or leave towels on more than one occasion. Screaming and noisy toddlers next door banging doors and walls for over a week and hotel didn't address it.
negative	It was scruffy and shabby and dirty in places. It is years overdue a refurbishment. It was expensive at $259 per night PLUS a resort tax of $46.62 per night. It was more 2 star than 4 star and I would not recommend it at all.Good wifi
negative	Baldly design hotel.it is an open concept with no direct access to lobby and restaurants.we had to get wet to go out of our room.floors are very slippery and dangerous. Apparently they told us that its a fire hazard if they close it up and the government will not allow it.Do not know how they got a 5 star rating.Overpriced .do not spend your money thereNothings
negative	The room and bathroom facilies need upgrading. The smelt moldy and the shower curtains we dirty, had mildew on themThe staff and the sea view
negative	The room was tiny and dirty, lacked facilities and was outdated. Nothing like the photos. It felt like other people were in the room with me as the walls are so thin, not to mention the bed bugs that must have been in that sponge foam mattress. I got out after one night and got a partial refund. Managed to find someone at short notice far, far better in every way apart from location, which is all you're paying for at the Quentin.Location was good.
negative	The property was in a different part of Melbourne to where we usually stay. It was a pleasant surprise as the location is in a leafy area of Melbourne and surrounded by lovely parks. It was also close to all the large sports and entertainment venues. The staff were great and the rooms large. Would fully recommend staying at this quiet location.
negative	There's no iron box in the room and they should make wider paces in the parking coz its too small parking space so due to that, the doors are touching to another car parked besidesLocation
negative	no room service no proper reception rooms not clean
negative	room looks nothing like the photos on booking.com Really grotty, shower horrible and bedroom horrible. Very noisy from the street as welllocation only good thing about this hotel
negative	The pictures for this hotel are very deceiving. There were mold in the walls , the ceiling was cracked, the bathroom was smeally and dirty, the beds linen were filthy which caused us rashes. Worst hotel experience ever and definitely not a 4 star quality hotel.The location
negative	Poor conditions seriously no aircon delaminating 1960 furnishings wifi only available in front of office extremely overpriced bording house embarrassed to take my children there seriously worst accommodation in my56 year existence it is a 30 dollar a night drunks bording house and im no snob still riding a bloody harley Davidson no angel at all but have slept under better trees and if the owner would like to engage me with his excuse my rebuttal would be gladly detailed and forthcomingLocationonly
negative	See above1. They gave us a room with a view to to a wall Next they gave me a room which smelled And looked completely different to the rooms we Booked I had to fight hard to get what I wanted After 4 times at the reception we figuered out they just have 3 rooms like what they sell wit pictures on the web It's a rip off! Breakfast cost 10$ but Espresso you have to pay extra The pool was great!
negative	Booked room with bathroom but I didn't had one and paid the same, changed room in the middle of the night because I had a live concert under and the windows don't close, to hot in the room...worst experience everNothing
negative	This is one of the nastiest Hotel I've ever stayed at the room was nasty the bathroom was filthy the walkway and carpet was just nasty I'm trying to figure out how I can get my money back. I would give this hotel , zero star out of five. The most hurtful part was I had my two small kids with me, we slept in our clothes because the hotel was so cold i took a shower my sandals because i didn't want to touch the tub. I called downstairs to ask them for more blankets they said they didn't have anymore.Nothing
negative	Rooms appalling - toilet and shower in 'pods' whose walls and roofs did not even reach the ceiling!! Booking.com needs to ensure that any accommodation listed at least meets basic requirements re facilities and rooms etc - otherwise the site cannot be trusted to provide 'recommended' places to stayConvenient location
negative	Rooms and facilities very basic and substandard for the high price charged. Everything, including bed linen smells and feels damp, towels very old and thin. This is certainly not a boutique hotel more like a backpackers hostel.View was superb even in the rain!
negative	Room flooded. Roaches. Smelled of cat urine strongly. Rooms had obviously not been cleaned or kept up with. I felt very unsanitary staying here. No phone in room to reach front desk. Lamp was broken. No towels. No room service checked on us.The price. That's it.
negative	MINI BANANA Guesthouse shows unreal pictures in booking. Actually, it is a restaurant with rooms in the same ground floor. We slept in a very small room with a tinny window. We couldn't sleep enough at night because there wasn't enough ventilation. In addition, toilets were next to our room so we could smell and hear people doing their needs. The owners resigned to give us another room with a bigger window and far from toilets at the same price. Moreover, you need to pass by the restaurant when you would like to take a shower. Our experience wasn't good at all, there are lot of hotels around whose price is lower and their facilities are much better than MINI BANANAThe guesthouse is well-located.
negative	First of all, you are able to hear everything that going on in the lobby as well as in the common room and tv room - and the additional bonus is you perfectly able to make out the sounds of your neighbour's toilet visits. And your are able to get a more exposed room than we got. So bring earplugs. Furthermore, within this price range you would expect soaps or towels. Additionally, you would expect warm water not lukewarm. Finally, the free wifi is so slow that it essentially not working.We didnt order it.
negative	Would never recommend this hotel to anyone. My friends put the envelopes with $ into the safety deposit box only to find that the someone stole 100$ from each of their envelopes. When the staff was politely offered to return it back, they started screaming and showing us videos of people entering our room, which was unclear and low quality. There was no one entering the room except for us and housekeeping. So the money just vaporized into the air. The room was $120 for 3 nights, we were robbed off for $200 and still had to pay for the room. Don't stay here, people will rob you and say it's alright.Good location.
negative	They didn't help me when I asked for help, they didn't help me with my package when I was leaving!! And I don't like the breakfast!!
negative	It's an old building with hard facilities, if you stay on the third floor you need to manage to take the stairs because there is no lift. I asked for a good view and there was no view. The toilet was disgusting and the breakfast was not good at all, unless you like only fruits and coffee. To be honest I was expecting a little bit more even knowing it was just one star hotel. Too expensive for what they offer though.The places nearby, there is everything in Catete and the beach is not far from the hotel which is an extra point.
negative	Poorly kept and furnished Unit. No Wi-Fi one small TV. Uncomfortable data and damaged furniture. From hanging out with stained and were mattresses. No option to purchase Wi-Fi or Internet. Even though advertise has free Wi-Fi.Good location
negative	Room very dirty; Bathe facility out of order; Bed was very uncomfortable; Staffs untrained.None
negative	Terrible smell of chlorine in the room, probably due to the bleach of the previous "cleaning". Wc with clear traces of urine on the tablet. Bath towels and bed sheets were dirty. For all day long there was non water in the bathroom due to works in the road. Ok, it's a coincidence, but the Hotel "must" warn in advance... since I was here for a work meeting and I can't use either wc or shower until evening.... Ridiculous room made from a broom closet, for 46 euro per night it's a robbery, obiusly they asked to me to pay before to see the roomPosition
negative	It was awful - old, dirty, not at all what the picture showed on the internet. I would've left if we hadn't already paid for the room. I was very disappointed and will never book there again!!!Nothing
negative	I was overcharged, when I asked for a break down of my room charges (a receipt) they would not give me one, the air conditioner didn't work even when we called to get it checked they would not offer to send someone to look at it or to change us to a different room, we were two couples and one room had single beds, there were no towels in the room,
negative	everything, starting from the dumbness and unwelcoming staff.Nothing
negative	Could not pull into the entryway as the police were arresting prostitutes. Do you even look at these hotels ? My family was really impressed!The drugs addicts greeting my family and I at the entrance was a warm welcome!
negative	It was a bad experience.The hotel's manager was extremely rude.We didn't get the room that we've booked,the only apology was to get 2$ back and the promise to have our room the next day...This didn't happened.We stayed in the same filthy room for one more night and the 3rd night we got another room,still not the one that we've booked.She claimed that this was better (unfortunately it was as dirty & disgusting as the first one) and she would charged us more than our booking price! We thought this was unfair...we paid,she took the money,no thank you or anything else... It's ok to make mistakes,but an apologie would be accepted... When you host people you have to learn how to be polite,it's not so hard! The only helpful and kind person was Gianni,an Italian guy,but you won't find him there anymore cause he also left...
negative	- staff unfriendly and absent when I was checking out - wifi only at reception, not in the room -mosquitos in the room as you couldnt close the window - no air conditioning - pictures on booking.com are not korrekt - breakfast 8-10 (too late for me) - most expensive room of my stay in brazil and the want payment for all days in advance - not clean- parking close to the hotel
negative	The room smelt of mould, the bathroom particularly. The AC was weak. There was a pub on the roof above us? Everyone there was under 30 and most were vest wearing flip flop drunkards. The receptionist, a tall young Asian chap was rude and really quite objectionable but then i suppose you would be if you had his lot. The breakfast was basically passable, not good though and the instant nescafe was poison. Avoid this festering overpriced dump if you possibly can.I didn't really like anything about it except the location.
negative	Every time we're there no toiletries all are missing from the room and used lotion shampoo or conditioner left for us in the room tampered with meaning used by previous guest and rooms are hot poor air condition, etc.Location is good only
negative	Everything was "closed" for season. The rooms were disgusting. The beds were hard. The entire facility smelled nasty. The elevators were dirty and "out of order". The sheets and pillow cases had not been changed. The bathroom was not cleaned. There was a ball of hair behind the door. The dishes in the room were dirty and we had to wash them before using them. The parking lot is small and you have to park across the street in a garage. The manager was kind enough to give us half of our money. The room was definitely not worth $90 for one night!It was on the beach.
negative	Dirty walls, windows, doors, shower, tired carpet, noisy neighbours, staff had to communicate with. Will not stay here again.The price as would have been very disappointed paying over $150 for what is termed a 'Superior One Bedroom Apartment'.
negative	Paper thin walls, no security. My daughter learned all kinds of colourful language from the party next door at 2:43 am. Staff were hard to locate and unsympathetic when found.
negative	The room was very very cold and uncorfortable, the heating wasn´t working and outside was freezing and raining. We had a lot of cold and we slept covered with 3 blankets! I don´t recommend anyone this hotel.In general nothing to stand out
negative	Bed was rock hard, bathroom is woeful, they have obviously added a shower and simply stuck a adjustable show rail in that only covers half the small bath so water goes literally everywhere. Do not take anything in to the room as it will get wet. Breakfast is great if you like cereal.Location
negative	Everything. I don't recommend it for familiesNothing. I had to cancel 2 nights
negative	Very uncomfortable, slept on springs not a mattress,no free Wi fi in the rooms , service is horrible.Nothing
negative	They have taken extra money of 150 euros and so far nobody is responding to my emails nor reminders. It has changed my good experience with them to a very bad one.
negative	I was given a bad smilly room at the far end of a carrador opposite to a janitor's store room in which they kept going to.. and loud-talk and slamming doors. I have brought it to front desk but no reply or change room.
negative	there was no collaboration from the hotel, they refused to give us an extra beds even if we will pay! they refused to give us an extra blankets and pillows, they wasn't helpful at all they was so strict and they made our life so hard.the room was spacious.
negative	These guys are absolute crooks. They charged my card in GBP instead of Euro at a rate which was completely no where near the spot rate for the day (costing an additional £40 more than it should have). They should have just charged me in Euro and let my bank work out the exchange rate. To make matters worse, when I raised the query with booking.com, the hotel sent them HALF a receipt showing that the amount had apparently been charged in Euro (which was a lie as I had seen the original receipt with my own eyes and it has been charged in GBP). I also confirmed with my bank that the amount had, in fact, been charged in GBP, not Euro. Pretty disgusted - no idea why they didn't just accept that they had done the incorrect thing instead of basically sending booking.com a fraudulent half receipt.
negative	Poor cleanliness. Staff with no smile and not so friendly. You have to walk on the street for 5 minutes with your bath robe to get to the beach.Dirty smelly room. Mold on the shower curtain. Poor internet connection that would go on and off. Staff not so friendly. Spa was ok. Dirty sticky carpets in the room.
negative	Was unable to sleep due to faulty air conditioning unit within the room which staff were unwilling to assist or relocate. The manager only got involved upon leaving the hotel and was also was not helpful and only used my negative experience as an attempt to try and get me to pay to stay again. Do not stay here.Looked very nice
negative	Irregular electricity and water supply. Dripping AC. Noisy (entire AC output under bedroom window). Need to ask for anything multiple times. No one even cared or asked if we had any issues. Tried to pin on us broken lamp at the end to increase the bill. Lots of mosquitoes.large room. great beach.
negative	One staff person was lovely but the others were very average. Bed wasn't king it was 2 singles pushed together. Had to ask for clean towel daily. They don't clean room while your there Room wasn't clean on arrival Air conditioner was extremely noisy it leaked wet carpet & our cloths, we reported it but no one got back to us. We were given a part refund on checking out It's not advertised that you have to pay for parking per night on top of room.. The view was great.
negative	Very small room, street noise very loud, no Airconditioning, no desk to work on, no car parking, nowhere to put suitcase but the floor, shower dirty, mini fridge in room was noisyAt least the sheets were clean
negative	The room was the size of a match box , smelly , pillows smelt , full blown cold winds blowing threw the window(even tho it was locked) , double bed was tiny and slanted . Would not recommend at all !! We only stayed the one night and left and went to one which was lovely clean and modern for the same price !!Location was ok.
negative	Not clean with spider web every where, mosquitoes,no access to basic service like tea and coffee.stuffy and fans are filled with dust which spreads in the tiny room once yhey are on. We stayed there in a family suit with privat bathroom.for one night to rest but no one rested!Lovely building. .looks like Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry from the outside.
negative	Horrible sound insulation (windows, doors). Could hear people in the room above talking. Could hear the conversations on the street even with windows closed. air con too loud. very hard pillows. poor choice of TV channels. bad location, hard to find a cab in the morning.Concierge was helpful. Hotel was clean.
negative	really dirty phone cord ripped out of wall bed lumpy no plug for bath tub must use shower air conditioner on full blast had to pull stool from under chair that had hair all over it to climb up and turn it down only stayed one night reserved for 2 lost money on reservation
negative	Cleanliness, bathroom was not up to standard, sink was dirty it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We stayed in room 103. Previous guests must have used spray on tan this was on the walls and floor. The shower tray and where the water runs off the doors was brown. I felt the stipling on the walls mde the room feel out of date and smaller. £100 a night is dear for a shoebox room.I liked the location it was perfect. Good TV in room. Coffee Facilities were good. Room was very quiet.
negative	Everything else. Room was sruffy, dirty, bed and pillows uncomfortable, dark and stuffy room, ants in the bathroom, noisy fan, smelly blanket, too small bedsheets. Horrible stay.The location
negative	The staff was very very rude, the dorm was so tiny with no place to store your bag. Only two bathrooms and we're always in use. This hostel is FAR from the center of town and there is no bus service. 40 minute walk to the first place you can eat at and there breakfast in the morning was very simpleNot a whole lot, the wifi was good
negative	The hotel is definitely not family friendly at all which I was unfortunately not aware of. My wife arrived a day later and I had made a reservation for 2 adults during my booking. The bell man ran up to the room, seemed upset and rude & said, sorry sir this is not allowed like I had committed a crime. Once I came down to the reception, the front desk staff wanted to charge me additional for her while the reservation I made was for 2 adults. They gave me an explanation which did not make sense since I am in the same hospitality industry. The issue was thankfully resolved with the manager however the bell man was not very happy.
negative	Carpet was dirty the room was cold of the night shower very hot or very cold not working properly no pressure extremely disappointed never will return
negative	The house keeping kept coming into the room every 10 mins annoying me and there were construction work being done so loud i couldnt sleep woke me up from early morning i was going to kill myself from the noise i was supposed to stay an extra 2 nights i cancelledNothing
negative	Old hotel, check in takes ages as all is done manually involving lot of paperworks and not computer. Rooms are old and very noisy facing the street although asked for quiet room. Breakfast is below average. No comfort at all. Too expensive!Nothing much actually
negative	The room was ver different from the one in pictures on the website. It was dusty and cold. We had the impression it was closed for a long time. The forniture was really obsolete and the wifi signal really weak. But the thing that disappointed us the most was the indifference of the staff to our complains.The position
negative	Besides the fact it was misleadingly advertised as it didn't mention there wasn't an ensuite bathroom, it was also very dirty to include mould, cobwebs and cockroaches. I fail to see why people have rated it so positively.
negative	It was a terrible night that I spent with my family in this miserable hotel. The general cleanliness, the availability of hot water, and the status of air conditioner all are a very bad experience to be checked.
negative	I'm suprised that this place has 7+ rating. The only thing that worked was the ac. Here im trying to say there was no water in the morning that the stuff offered us to shower in bathroom in parking lots. The wifi didn't work for 2 minutes at a time.Nothing
negative	The room was not clean. It was dusty. Our reservation was deluxe room for 3 adults, they didn't provide that. The staff was not polite at all and they didn't even care to fix the issues. The room was very cold and they didn't fix the AC.
negative	rooms old and dirty, do not reflect what is shown on the pictures, bed mattress very old and uncomfortable breakfast very bad for the price , very few options and very low quality, charged for the coffee night buffet disgusting, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone
negative	Bathroom dirtyBed were lousy & hardcore.. Not a standard room service preparation
negative	Yshmael, and the night auditor. They make you feel you are not welcome. Not willing to assist, and very unhelpful. They made me and my family feel not welcome whenever we approach then during our stay. Will definitely not consider this hotel again when we are back in Paris!!Location and Nicolas. He was very helpful and the only good thing I remember in our stay. I was looking forward to seeing him at the counter everyday.
negative	Terrible location drug infested very sketchy.The price
negative	The first room I was given was in another building. It was down a dank dreary hallway with a broken lock and doorknob. The shower was horrible. The bed and bedding was horrible and it had a very bad odor. The elevator was quite an experience. Don't do it. The second room was better, but no hot water the next day. The shower floor was sinking. The bed and bedding was horrible again. I wanted to have a true New Orleans experience and as good as NO is I will take this bad and NEVER book a room again.The only good thing about this hotel was the location. This hotel should have not been more than $40 given the condition.
negative	OMG THE WORST EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD, Staff in this hotel very even super rude, not trained, service is very poor, they were always shouting on guests even for me, I WILL HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE, when i was check in staff they were shouting on one guest who was staying there, and when i checked out they did not even help us with our baggage and we carried by our self, also WIFI they were giving a password every single day new ones, which is you have to go and collected by yourself, they are saving on WIFI & electricity, VERY VERY BAD HOTEL, THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN,Location
negative	Rooms grubby Reception staff terrible didn't understand me at all had to move rooms as phone didn't work hairdryer didn't work no air conditioning terrible facilities restaurant closedLocation
negative	There was no AC in the room, it was super hot and stuffy . We asked for carpark but when we went to check in we were told parking is fully booked . The man at reception told us no hotels in town provide parking which is untrue, spent an hour looking for off street parking . Won't recommend this to anyoneNothing at all
negative	Room was smelling and staff was very rude... location was reqlly bad..Absolutely rubbish hotel. Staff was rude and room was smelling. Location slumdog... guys never go to this hotel ever...
negative	No tv on the room no telephone the room very small and very noise cause of the airport we could hear the plain every 5 mins.Only the view
negative	The pictures don't correspond to the reality at all. The room was very dirty. No sheets on the bed, only an old dirty cover. The towels were dirty and had holes. We didn't even use the shower because of how dirty the bathroom was. We couldn't rest because of loud music played in front of the hotel. The food we had for dinner was awful. A local told us that the hotel recently changed its name because of all the bad reviews it was getting (you can see the previous name in the pictures).The woman at the reception speaks good English. Nice view on Adam's peak from the balcony.
negative	The room I booked is called a suite but is clearly designed for a family who looks for comfort instead of quality. E.g.: a big white refrigerator next to your bed is not what I think of when booking a suite. Or a very used sofa that is clearly only there because of the bed option. The note is probably perfect for people who look only for comfort and don't care about quality.Location
negative	All about their facilities and staff. Disgusting!!!.Nothing..!!!
negative	The staff, the policy, the location, the amount, its total overall sucks!It was disgusting, best of the worst, it does nothing but spoiled the moment and the event. My worst experience in hotel ever, staffs are never at all accomodating, chooses who they attend and who's not!!!
negative	There was almost no equipment in the apartment not even a kettle. NO jay cloths etc poorly equipped over all. Wifi go was so spasmodic and considering it was extra that was bad. Staff ok but not great. I would not come back as the value for money was not good other places right on the coast were cheaper.
negative	There was a no teethbrush and they don't clean the room and also there was no shampoo and rinse and also they dont give free wifi,, free-wifi is just for lobby. not for room...no like
negative	The first room 223, was across the alley from a store called Wolfe's Museum of mystery and the noise was horrible and lout. There was very little heat available in the rooms that we used. Julia was rude and punished us for complaining about the first room and then the second room. Julia should be fired. I am a Viet Nam Vet and 76 years old and she showed me no respect.
negative	NO ENGLISH CHANNELS ON TV ADVERTISED AS SATELITE TV ONLY MET 1 STAFF THAT SPOKE ENGLISH ADVERTISED AS A 4* LOOK AT THE PICS AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND UP ABOVE SHOWER ALL PLASTER OFF THE CEILING AND DOWN THE BEDROOM WALL TEA AND COFFEE MAKING FACILITIES A POT THAT NEVER BOLILS NO KETTLEThe pool area was nice and a lovely seating area outside to sit in
negative	receptionist were not friendly, bathroom so dirty specially tub and curtain, no kettle and TV is so difficult to use, net too slow, balcony sliding door didn't open, will never book it again.frankly there is not much to tell, the only good thing was the mattress which it good in anywhere.
negative	After returning for the second time to check in, the room was still not ready/ clean. Checking out was also a disaster; the pinmachine was broken so we had to go to the ATM, when we paid with cash they had no change so they refused the money untill we went to a restaurant to change it ourselfs. Really Bad service. The room was overpriced (maybe because of tet). Not clean: used glasses in sink, toothbrush collecting dust, weird spots on floor. No sheets for the bed. Staff was really uninterested and slacky. Not a good experience.The hotel had a good location. Close to the beach. But that is the only positive thing about the hotel.
negative	In my considered opinion this hotel is a piece of crap and I think booking.com has not done the reality check before listing this property on their site. Bed size is small and uncomfortable and they have hidden charges which makes you feel cheated. Besides the food is pathetic as I got a rotten potato with omelette and stale smoothy. They charged me extra 1500 plus taxes for my wife over and above 5000 plus taxes. I paid 29000 for 3 days for which amount I could have stayed at Taj or Oberoi'sLocation of property
negative	Rooms were disgusting, paint peeling of the wall's, scuff marks all over the walls, very dirty, shower did not work , had to have a bath with my son and the plug didn't even fit, very disappointed for the price and don't see myself staying there againLocation is pretty much all it has going for it and nice swimming pool
negative	Dont stay here. They have no heat, no cups in the room, you cant fall asleep because of the noise and cold . You can also hear everyone in the hotel moving on the bed, watching tv, etc, along with every noise from the outside . It was HORRIBLE. The bed is moving. They also dont speak English. The feeling was that I was sleeping in the metro station in a jacket. On top of this, the restroom is less than 1m2 and Im a tiny girl and it was hard to take a shower or wash my face there. Thank God this is over.
negative	1.Fire alarm has been off 2 times early in the morning and there has been no single communication from the hotel staff( Bear in mind this is a floating hotel!!) 2.If you wanna be told off just stay at Good Hotel as staff extremely successful telling guests off.... 3.Oh forgot to add tea and coffee making facilities in the room means NO TEA, NO COFFEE, NO MILK instead herbal tea! This hotel dictates that Guest MUST PAY for coffee and tea in the reception cafe! Never coming back to this dungeon again! Travelled 63 countries stayed in tons of hotels, as a Booking.com genious and London Guru one word for this property and staff 'INCOMPETENT''! Don't try to call Booking.com customer service as they are non existent too!!!!Not a single thing can be liked about this dump....
negative	Breakfast was terrible, we had to sit down, got a fried egg full of ground pepper, half a bread, 3 pieces of fruit, 2 mini sausages, white instant coffee, no choice! At 7 am the school next door opens up and is vey noisy with music and a speaker. Not so friendly receptionist. Dirty beds. TV not working. Dirty flipflops for guest use. Very slow water from the shower. Not clean. Very dirty toilet in communal space.Garden.
negative	Terrible area especially for a single female. Filthy walls, skirting boards, grouting in the bathroom. Furniture was tatty, towells threadbare.Fridge and microwave
negative	old and dirty noisy rainwater pouring into rooms ( literally ) windows do not close the door is tin as it can get doest make you feel safe at all for first time travellers to Mendoza, choose a different facility. ah also how hard is it to put a lightbulb into the lighting in the room. not even metioning the ducktape on the back of the tv remote to hold the batteries together. its a joke..nothing
negative	Worst experience staying there..waste of moneyIt was near to vagator beach
negative	Nothing I liked bad smell dirty the hotel sucks and paid to much money for worst experienceNothing one of the worst experience of my life never again. The hotel sucks!!
negative	The room's bathroom was filthy- hairs in and around the sink on arrival. There is not enough car park spaces for the number of guests staying in the hotel. Breakfast was of poor quality. Rooms were very disappointing compared to the pictures used to advertise the hotel. Overall very disappointing experience
negative	everything.. there was no view as said, felt very unsafe. poor car park, hired car got scratched by hedges (very mad). need to get rid of those hedges, the room smelt as I first walked in. stand up fans in bedrooms no air cons in rooms only lounge room ridiculous and only 1 air con for a 2 bedroom family room. the windows had cardboard wedged in between the windows to stop it from making noises. found rubbish jammed in lounge chairs, the beds need to be replaced,nothing to like, only the 1 staff was very friendly.
negative	Everything was bad: The room way too small (or way too many people in it), the air in the rooms was so bad as (one couldn't open the window properly and there was no additional ventilation), the showers steaming hot or ice cold. This resulted in a poor overall experienceNothing
negative	It was filthy, no one answering calls or emails, felt hostile, stains on carpets, paint peeling off walls, didn't have breakfast because we were scared of what we would find in the basement dining roomThe view was stunning
negative	We had extra visitors in our room, ANTS. I woke up the next morning with bites over my face. Housekeeping were already aware of the problem, yet we were put in this room. We asked to be moved and were ignored. We checked out. Very rude and unhelpful Duty Manager and reception team.Nothing
negative	Terribly incapable staff. Breakfast was underwhelming not enough for the number of guests. We've experienced 2 days with no water. WiFi did not work at all.
negative	Change of staff on receptionStaff in reception very bad Room was dirty. Save box out of service
negative	The next building to the hotel is under heavy construction. There was no any info on booking.com about that. I especially asked for quite room which obviously was not fulfilled, but a person at Reception greeted me with something like: we've arranged quiete room for you, faced to the yard - sounds like a bad joke. I'll try never believe booking.com rating again.
negative	Location but nothinelse. I will not go back.Staff is not kind and did ignore my request to fix the toilet once and they only did it after I insisted. Staff also ignored my request to correctly configure the tv and I had to insist.
negative	Beds were uncomfortable. Didn't like the view. Carpark too small no parking even though I paid and reserved parking.The lady at the desk went over and beyond for me.
negative	Not meet my expectations as advertise.Giving me 2 single bed combine together. Not comfortable.Not many choices and varieties of food during breakfast.No free parking in front of the hotel as requested. Can't get the new wing. As first time customer you should give a warm welcome which I might choose your hotel again. I will not recommend this hotel to others.
negative	The air-cond did not function well the whole night, it was very warm and I didn't sleep well. Besides I waited for hot water for more than 10 mins before I could take my shower, I was freezing cold while waiting for the water to become warmer in order to take my shower. My family also found a small screw on the floor by stepping on it.
negative	Room was small Street noise was obvious (bad windows) Staff was doing work when we arrived so the room smelled like paint Staff is very unprofessional (different room prices mentioned, forgetting to give back the passport) Real hotel name is different than mentioned hereDecent breakfast
negative	I stayed there for one night , I forgot my shoes and a bag , I called them later they insisted they did not find it , It took me hard time to even speak to someone, They always promise a call back and no body does, I had to call more that 10 times and the answer is they didn't find the shoes and the bag , I'm sorry but I will never ever go back this hotel again
negative	he couch were of a very poor quality, we could feel the frame digging on our back and skin, no provision of extra sheets. TThe fact that the owner is willing to accomodate us for extra person, but very unwilling to help once you arrive.
negative	I would never stay here again. We were not able to check-in for several hours as the computers were down. The lobby was cold and full of very unhappy guests. It was January and the heating in the room did not work but the staff did not inform us of this upon check in. We requested a room change but were told we could not because of the "special" booking price. A tiny portable heater was provided which made no difference. The duvets were paper thin, more for summer than winter. No chance we would ever be confortable in the cold, dreary room. We requested to cancel our booking so we could find a more suitable hotel. The hotel said we must call Booking.com. They said only the hotel could refund our money. I offered a compromise and pay for one night of a two night booking. The manager refused. So we left the hotel with our bags on a cold rainy day and found a decent place to stay. $430 wasted. They can keep my money, I will keep my dignity.Absolutely Nothing!
negative	Cold shower only, no option for hot. Insects in bed, hard pillow, dirty room, rude receptionist, broken TV that sounded like it was going to blow up when tried to switch on. WORST bit was broken lock on doors, couldn't enter, had to get staff to open, and couldn't exit, had to wait in the morning for the cleaner to walk past and open the doors for us.Nothing really except it's on a nice island
negative	Average, very average hostel. Bad management (they never spoke with us), bad service, in weekend place is run as a bar, not a hostel (party going on till Midnight. Loud music and chatter. We're not invited, nor informed) If you complain around midnight (so not at 10 pm or 11 pm but midnight) they say, we can put the volume down), many mosquitos (no mosquitos nets in room), no towels for guests, bad wifi (most of time down), no warm water, very poor breakfast. Worst: total mismatch between price ($35 per night) and value. Last but not least: Strong suspicion these guys overrated their hostel themselves. An average rating of 8,8 is ridiculous (19 ratings only) as is their price of $35 a night. This hurts your image and reliability as Booking.com as well. So please check this out well!Nice island but hard to reach and most biz (hotels, restaurants) on the island went bankrupt.
negative	I paid a little more, expecting something special. Unfortunately the hotel was incredibly average, or maybe even less than that. I don't think I would ever return.
negative	Staff were not friendly & room was smelly.Nothing.
negative	The rooms were cold throughout the night and didn't warm up until the next morning... when it was time to leave. The manager told us this is their policy to be green. I won't be back for a long time... when they change their policy.We arrived at 8:00 PM and the room was cold. They turned on the electric heater because it was turned off. We went out and returned back for 12 am. The room was still cold. Barely any heat at all.
negative	Everything ... whole place surrounding the b&b is a total dive with unwelcoming people touting for favours and location is a hidden maze you would want to avoid at all costs. Once outside you will be completely lost. A nightmare. Stay at home!
negative	No soundproof even at the 12th floor, dark room, light come in from the courtains at night. Poor breakfast, extremely low cleaness standard and room facilities. Sheets too Short so sleep with our legs on the mattress. Never againNothing
negative	Shower leaked all over our clothes and the wifi was more like WF as there was not internet. Also I couldn't get hard which I put %50 down to the colour of the showerThe polish guy who went on my tinder was jokes.
negative	Noise heard the drunks beside and below throughout the night. Cigarette Butts everywhere we walked on the property. Room did not like anything like the website. Thought that we were staying the a hotel not a motel. Reception said they couldn't do anything. We wanted to move to another Days Inn and they wouldn'the cancel our reservation here.Beds were ok
negative	Room was too small compared to even Budget hotels. Double bed provided was only Super single size but room totally has no walk space. Shower facilities was bad And the staff's attitude was rude as well. Totally not recommended.
negative	The room should be cleaned thorougly . Replace the brown towels with white towels . Replace the throw , it's very old not presentable for a studio considering the value for money people pay . Replace the Tv with modern smart Tv .The room did not have a nice smell .Sheets were clean .
negative	The rooms are stuffy and the staff didn't take my luggage to my room during checking in. The receptionist wouldn't give me another room until the manager stepped in. The hotel has old furniture with stains on it. So do the rooms with wallpaper. The hotel Needs an upgrade.Free wi-fi only
negative	No extra blanket in very cold night and gave us light one after many tough negotiations . And brought us 2 extra pillows without cover Toilet was not clean and when we asked to clean it, it was not done properly WiFi was very bad almost nil AC was not working properly abd can't set temperature and when told them they said it's not working turn it off we r new opening !!!!Staff were good
negative	Everything I didn't like. Bad location. Bad bad bad.Nothing. They trick people by showing good rooms but put them in a dark, terrible and small room. Some section are upgrade and some are not. Shown as 4 stars but is not even 2 star. Motels with 2 stars are better than this property.
negative	This was by far the worst room I have ever stayed in , it was dirty sheets not cleaned in a week(and was ripped ) , complimentary food in room out of date and mouldy, the room was in the basement and no windows which was correct ,but the smoke detector base was on ceiling but no smoke detector so if a fire we wouldn't know or get out, wall paper peeling of wall, the walls were filthy and the toilet had no door .Nothing at all
negative	all pathetic - rickety and noisy beds, electricity problems, ants crawling on the windows. No cleanliness and staff help.Only good thing about it was the location.
negative	Jess Front desk person was very rude gave us a room that was not clean and said occupied on it and we just were very disappointed moved us to another room but we spent over an hour she would not get a manager and she would not accommodate us in anyway I'm disputing charges very unhappy with booking.com they gave us two queen size bed's and even though your disclaimer said based on availability you did not make it clear that they were only queen size beds available as a website you should update availability , The hotel casino was not accommodating at all I'm booking.com was in able to help at that time we've been driving for over 6 1/2 hours and we did not need that that evening have those problems with your services in the hotel they even told us ,,if we didn't like it we could leaveThe Spanish restaurant was very good quality food and service was excellent
negative	The location of accomodation is very unsafe very isolated with no service provider or assistant to be seen, thectent itself is attractive but it would have been amazing had it been on the hill area near the restaurant not on a plot alongside the westcoast road!! Really bad location its a joke!and one has to travel by car cross another road to go up a hill to breakfast or restaurant..even for cup of coffee...The view from the restaurant
negative	Don't book here. It may be cheap, but you'll hate the stay, even at the cheap price it's at. For its negatives, it should be priced at $50 a night. Everything was bad... Urine on the toilet seat from previous guest No soap in the bathroom No air conditioning No parking Staff that were not helpful Very uncomfortable bed + more
negative	uncomfortable room. the bed is less than what is written on the reservation. we changed two rooms, but the bed was both very small. below 150 cm how it was written.
negative	I was stabbed in my bed by a needle that was left by a cleaner. It left a scar of approx 3 inches in my hand. The manager was not available to speak and would not offer a refund as I was told "Booking.com" hold the money and we have nothing to do with it. I was offered a free breakfast in exchange for being stabbed in bed. This is the only issue I have with the hotel and I feel it was not resolved in a mutually accepted manner, I would like booking.com to make contact to the hotel to confirm this was the case. Other than this, the hotel was nice.I liked the comfort of the hotel, The views were amazing are the hotel was well kept around the lobby area and also in the rooms.
negative	Room was not overly clean for sure, was there for six nights and the room was never serviced. no change of bedding, towels, or garbage taken out. Light bulbs were missing and never replaced. Could not take a bath as there was no mechanism in the tub but could have a shower.Nothing really
negative	Mini bars didn't work in the room, no alcohol served at the property even though alcohol was on display, and room staff didn't clean rooms properlyThe rooms
negative	There is a long list of hotel policies they present immediately after they take your money including the fact that they don't put the heating on until the inside room temperature drops to 7 degrees C !!! I've I new I was going camping I would have prepared myself but at £90 per. Ugh this this is insane. I arrived with my wife and baby and had a terrible 2 nights' sleep. At one point my daughter was so cold I was terrified for her health. They also told me (just after taking my money) that they had no baby crib despite me emailing them to request one and did nothing to sort one out. The hotel is also filthy. This hotel is a joke.
negative	Price is too expensive, I booked one room not sure why I have given 2 room which unnecessary.Location
negative	WiFi not working; Staff refused to move us to a floor that had another wifi connection available; Heating failing thru night; Two single beds put together (not comfortable); Staff non-cooperative on use of common open area for smoking;Breakfast was nice
negative	Poor quality , lack of professional managment,cheapest breakfast consumables & equipment .sad internet. We could not take anymore of this shoddy ficility- May have been good some years ago. . We checked out 1day early & were happy to forfit the cost.nothing !!
negative	Never served breakfast in time hence I skipped waited for 90 minutes to get breakfast.awful serviceNever liked anything worst hotel
negative	Smells of mothballs upon entering. Toilet smells damp n ceiling roof not closed properly.None. Picture of room was ok. But was disappointed with the toilet n room
negative	They put me in the joining room, and the next room with kids playing and parents to noisy even late night already, two nights in a row I haven't had a rested night at all even I called the reception to change my room into a quite room and not in a joining room, they never change my room. The staff charged me double in my credit card, when I booked online, and when I've had checked in and out in my debit card. I hope that they will send it back into my account quickly. Over all I'm not happy with the hotel and service.Location
negative	No double bed when booked one so give a room with 2 singles pushed together, no double quilt for the bed, terrible pillows and I would just never stay there again it's absolutely awful I heard so many people complaining it was unreal.Nothing at All the hotel couldn't even give us a double quilt after paying 95 pounds for a room
negative	They didn't provide facilitiesFacilities were not good
negative	Poor value for money! There were very few facilities provided (not even a hairdryer for example) which we would have expected at this price point. Towels provided were not clean (one appeared to have a blood stain, the other hairs). Luckily there were enough spare as we were in a family room. Very uncomfortable beds, combined with a noisy evening (we were staying in a unit above one with a dog) meant we were overall disappointed! Door between living room and bedroom would not stay closed and the bathroom door would either not lock at all, or lock us inside!Good location within walking distance from Newmarket.
negative	Cockroaches and bugs in the bathroom. No towel for hands, filthy shower, leaking water from sink. Promised free breakfast between 07.00 to 10.30 but 09.00 day nr 2 they didn't offer breakfast.Nice sheets and blanket
negative	The images and descriptions on booking.com did not match the reality and that is extremely disappointing after traveling so far to find that the pictures and descriptions are not as presented online ! PLEASE ADRESS THIS ASAP !Massage was good & Cat from the reception in the Laguna wing was exceptionally good !
